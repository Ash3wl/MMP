---Ash/Vandal---

Ash: (grin) Why hello there, VANDAL SWIFTBLADE!!

Vandal: (hurt) Oh no... it's you.

Ash: Oh? Why the long face? I just wanna have a chat with my buddy.

Vandal: (neutral) Ash, you know why. Just leave me alone.

Ash: Oh, ouch, Vandal.y I'm hurt.

Vandal: Fuck off.

Ash: Oh so hurt~

Vandal: Fuck off!

Ash: Heh. Fine then, I'll leave you be.

(Ash leaves)

Vandal: Damn it... Marc didn't tell me he'd be here.

---Ash/Smilies---

Ash: Smilies, good to see you actually showed up.

Smilies: Well, you called me over. What? Did you think I wouldn't show up?

Ash: (frowns) ...I'll admit... I had my doubts.

Smilies: (frowns) Ash, I'm not THAT cold, you know. I don't just ghost on people when they're expecting something of me.

Ash: (normal) Wow, that's awfully specific. You seem slightly OOC there.

Smilies: (normal) Quit it.

Ash: Ahahah, sorry.

Smilies: Well, anyways, we probably don't have much longer to chat. So, let's switch focus to the battle again.

Ash: Right.

---RS/Ash---
RS: Ash?

Ash: Oh, R.S? What's up?

RS: Forgive me if I'm bothering you, but I simply wanted to see if you could chat.

Ash: Huh? Yeah, sure, dude. I don't mind?

RS: Is that so? I'll admit, I hesitate to do so. You always seem to have something you're mulling over.

Ash: Huh? Oh, no no! It's no big deal.

RS: I would assume it would be, given your position as Cheif of Staff. You oversee all of us, taking orders directly from General Ciraxis, unlike most the time for the rest of us.

Ash: Listen... I don't... It's not that big of a deal to stop and chat. Maki is a big help nowadays.

RS: Your secretary, right?

Ash: Mhm. (Show new Ash Thinking CG) Now I can relax a bit more, and think about my own well-being more. I was a bit lacking before... Though, some things never change, it seems. (remove CG) Oh, sorry. I went off a bit there. So, how's your daughter?

RS: No, it is alright. And she is doing well, I appreciate your asking.

Ash: Anything else on your mind?

RS: I believe this is enough to sate my curiousity.

Ash: Chill. Good chat.
