My invisibility reduces the workload
on the artists!|\s[nil]\s[-1]Anyway, this world contains many features you
may recognize from FE7x, so watch out!\wait[10]
(If you haven't played FE7x, you should.)|\scrollFor example, most weapons have +2 might
compared to what you're used to from FEGBA.
Also, you can hold 6 items.|
Bows get WTA at 2 range and WTD at 1 range,
and if you don't have any equipped weapons,
you always get WTD!|
Something cool you can do is, if you talk to
someone, you can still perform other actions, so
don't hesitate to stop by and chat!|
A couple units have skills that affect their
movement which are somewhat buggy. If they
act up, just suspend and resume.|
There's no permadeath, but do mind your weapon
uses! There are four parts, now after all. Oops,
did I spoil that?|\scrollAnyway, have some gold, and good luck!|</Value>

himself in a big pot of trouble
when he got surrounded by wild
hounds!\w[15] He goodness-be would
have died had I not rode in on

could take care of all of us.\w[10]

      <Value>\f[5|Smilies]\f[2|Ash]\s[5]Ash.|\s[2]So,\w[5] you acually came.\w[10]
You were a little late to
the party,\w[5] you know.|\s[5]You didn't exactly specify
where in the Black Market
we would be meeting.|\s[2]What?\w[15]
I couldn't have...|\scroll\e[2|2]...\w[15]Did I really?|\s[5]You didn't.|\s[2]\e[5|2]Smilies,\w[5] I'm sorry,\w[5] man.\w[10]
I never usually forget stuff
like that.|
It's just five in the morning,\w[5]
and I was in a bit of a rush,\w[5]
so,\w[5] I forgot.|\s[5]It's no big deal,\w[5] really.\w[10] I'm always
willing to help you five out.|
Wasn't difficult to find your group.\w[10]
Had a quick run over with my
horse and spotted Ciraxis.|
Just try not to leave out such
an important detail next time.|\s[2]R-Right.|\scroll\e[2|0]Well,\w[5] It's good to see you
actually showed up.|\s[5]What?\w[15] Did you think
I wouldn't show up?|\s[2]\e[2|2]...\w[15]I'll admit...\w[15]
I had my doubts.|\s[5]Ash,\w[5] I'm not THAT cold,\w[5] you know.\w[10]
I don't just ghost on people when
they need me for something.|\s[2]\e[2|0]Gee,\w[5] that's awfully specific.|
Didn't take you for one to hold
a grudge.\w[10] Talk about out of
character.|\s[5]\e[5|0]Quit it.\w[10] That was not the intention,\w[5]
\e[2|3]and I'm sure you realize that.|\s[2]Ahahah,\w[5] sorry.|\s[5]Well,\w[5] anyways,\w[5] we probably don't
have much longer to chat.|
\e[2|0]So,\w[5] let's switch focus to the

help of an old buddy.|\e[5|2]\s[5]It's fine.\w[10] It wouldn't have been
nice of me to refuse,\w[5] haha.|\e[2|7]\s[2]That's also at least one more person
who hasn't tried to kill\e[5|3] me,\w[5] here
helping me.|\s[5]I wonder\e[2|0] how many of those
exist at this point.|\s[2]Now that you mention it...|\scroll\e[2|7]A LOT of people have tried to kill me by
now,\w[5] huh?\w[15] Evil clones,\w[5] magic chinchillas...\w[15]
I wish they would tone it down a notch.|\e[5|2]\s[5]I think it's pretty obvious,\w[5] why there's
a lot of them.\w[10] \e[5|0]Every hero\e[2|3] needs a villain,\w[5]
if I were to guess.|\s[2]I guess?|\scroll\e[2|0]I'm getting bored of being the hero all the
time.\w[10] It's getting so overdone by this point.\w[10]
\e[2|7]I'm not even that heroic\e[5|3] of a character.|\s[5]So you'd rather be an enemy?|
\e[5|2]Hasn't that been done before,\w[5] though?|\e[2|0]\s[2]Yeah I know,\w[5] but like...|\scroll\e[2|1]I feel like I can be an awesome fucking villain.\w[10]
I'd just need some good motivation and shit.|\s[5]I wonder about that.|\scroll\e[5|3]Though from a technical standpoint,\w[5] I--\wait[15]\s[2]Yeah like,\w[5] I feel like I can be have this
really cool\e[5|2] gray morality.|
You know,\w[5] make the player question
his ideals and shit?|
Then you can have this sick battle where
Reisen and I wo--\wait[15]\s[5]I know what you're getting at.|
I mean...\w[15]\e[5|0] I would say\e[2|0] it can be good.|\s[2]I dunno.|\scroll\e[2|7]I wouldn't say it's relatively easy,\w[5] but
you know,\w[5] like,\w[5] \e[2|1]I always advise people
to think outside the box and shit.|\e[5|3]\s[5]I mean sure,\w[5] that's all good and all,\w[5] but...\w[15]
It doesn't\e[2|3] solve the issue.|\s[2]Huh?\w[15]\e[5|2]|\s[5]Didn't you just say you wanted people
to "tone it down"\e[2|0] with killing you?|
\s[2]I did.\w[10]\e[5|3]|\s[5]If you're the enemy,\w[5] that only
makes it worse.|\s[2]...\w[15]\e[2|7]Fuck.|\scrollI guess I'm always prone to dying
no matter what.\w[10] \e[2|0]Can't I get a break
for a change?|\scroll\e[2|7]...\w[15]\e[5|2]\wait[20]|\s[5]Don't look at me like that.\w[10] \e[5|3]You were
the one who named it Ragefest.\w[10]
\e[5|0]I just did what you asked for.|\s[2]Alright.|\scroll\e[2|0]Guess I'll just go die then.|\s[-2]\f[2|nil]\w[5]\s[5]Ah Marc...\w[15]

What is it?|\s[2]We must talk.|\s[5]Make it quick.|\s[2]\e[2|3]Just why am I here,\w[5] exactly?|\s[5]Because I ordered you to be here.|\s[2]This isn't my responsibility.|\s[5]Oh,\w[5] what's that about now?|\s[2]\e[2|3]I was only recently hired as the Chief
of Security.\w[10]\e[2|0] I've only barely begun

Can't blame you for missing it,\w[5] honestly.\w[10]
It was written in invisible\e[2|4] ink and all.|\s[2]...\w[15]That's nonsense.|\s[5]"The subject's assignments,\w[5] job description

Your name was...Matthew\e[5|1]?|\s[5]OH YEAH, I do know you!
You're the bread delivery guy!|\scrollYour bread is amazing, by the way.|\s[2]Freshest\e[5|0] in the business.|\s[5]What are you doing here though?
\e[5|2]I wouldn't expect a baker in this

work to do\e[5|0].|\s[5]I see.|\scroll\e[5|1]A baker and a fighter?
You must have quite the life.|\s[2]I guess you could say that.|\scrollI've heard that you're a fighter too.
You've helped Marc once before,
haven't you?|\s[5]Ah, yes, that was quite a trip.|\scroll\e[5|0]Though my team seems a lot less...
"dynamic" than yours.|
You seem very..."cheery"\e[2|3] compared
to the others.|\s[2]I'll take that as a compliment.|\scroll\e[2|0]You seem pretty "cheery" yourself,
you know.|\s[5]\e[5|2]You got me there, I guess.
\e[5|0]Sounds like I barely know
you at all, huh?|\s[2]We can catch up later if you want.
Maybe over\e[5|1] some bread?|\s[5]Sounds good to me!
I'll be sure to order a
lot more from now on.|\s[2]The Agonist Bakery thanks
you for your business.|\s[5]Oh yeah, and your name is...?|\s[2]Purt.
Purt Agonist\e[5|0].|\s[5]...|\scrollOh. \e[5|2]That's uh...\wait[20]definitely\e[2|3]

get you for a bit?|\s[-2]\s[5]What is the reason for this, Sir?
Is there some sort of issue?|\s[2]No, no, it's none of that.
I was just hoping we could
have a nice talk\e[5|3].|
You work for me, yet I hardly
know you at all.|\s[5]You request information?|\s[2]I guess you could say that...|
This isn't work though, I just
want to talk. It will be good
for both of us, I feel.|\s[5]Just...\wait[20]talk? \e[5|2]Ah, I comprehend.|
Is this is a safety procedure?
Fortifying bonds to increase battle
prowess.|
If so, I'll gladly abide by my duty, Sir.|\s[2]Uh...\wait[20]sure\wait[20]...
If that makes it
easier for you.|\s[-2]\wait[60]\e[2|2]\wait[60]\s[2]So...\w[20]yeah\w[20]...|\scrollAren't you going to say
something? \e[2|0]What is it
that's holding\e[5|0] you up?|\s[5]That would be the ground\e[2|2], Sir.|\s[2]No, I didn't mean\w[20]... \e[2|0]Nevermind, listen...
You're the Chief of Security, aren't you?
Something interesting must have happened.|
Just tell me about how your day was.|\s[5]Oh, I see now.|\scroll\e[5|2]Would you like to receive
my daily report, Sir?|\s[2]Yeah, sure, \e[5|0]that works.|\s[5]At exactly 10:47 in the morning, a soldier
was seen slipping some sort of powder
on Lord Ciraxis' usual breakfast, sir.|
The soldier was immediatly sent to the
"Fun House" until further notice.|\s[2]Oh, really?
Did someone try to
poison Ciraxis?|\s[5]After further analysis, the powder was
identified as salt.\e[5|3]|
We tried to contact the accused soldier
afterwards, but we couldn't get a response
over his bloodcurdling screams.|
\e[5|0]At 15:18, the sound of footsteps was heard
on the garden. \e[5|2]The Chief of our Air Force,
Soh, dealt with the invader.|
\e[5|0]The trespasser was a kid who lost his ball
after playing.|\s[2]...|\s[5]\e[5|3]The ball was successfully retrieved, though the
kid may be in need of mental help, Sir. His mount\e[2|2]
had some\wait[20]... difficulties, you could say.|
\e[5|0]\e[2|0]At 18:53, officers Wally and Warren were seen 
trying to steal Fleet Admiral Neal's beverage
supplies, and have been relocated to subject
186-F's testing grounds.|
\e[5|2]At 03:26, I personally took care of all soldiers
who were sleeping before our appointed bedtime
of 10 AM, Sir.|
\e[5|0]At 04:43, a red sock was seen mixed with the
laundry of--\wait[15]\s[2]Listen, just stop right there, please.

output by 40%.|\s[2]No, that's the opposite of what
