      <Value>\f[2|Uther]\f[1|Madelyn]\f[4|Magnus]\f[5|Hassar]\f[6|Harken]\g[Hill]\s[2]This looks like the place.
The message wasn't very clear...|\s[5]\x[105]Whether it is or not, something 
is wrong here.\w[10]
May I reconnoiter the area?|\s[2]Please, do.
Take these two with you.|\s[-2]\f[5|nil]\wait[5]\f[4|nil]\f[6|nil]\wait[20]\f[6|Abelia]\f[4|Mazda]\s[4]\x[85]I'd say your friend was on the money.
I've overseen at least three of these
operations, myself.|\s[2]Can you tell us
anything useful?|\s[4]\x[85]Shit, for what you're payin', I'll draw
schematics of all our formations.|
The scheme's pretty simple; we
take the guise of a mercenary force
and set up in a warehouse or the like.|
Dump a wagon o' gold on the owner and
he won't be sayin' much to the guards.|\s[1]\x[150]...|\s[4]\x[85]After we've got a good gauge of
the security, we find a window, offer
our services to whoever's in charge|
and take the keep from inside out.|
Turn the siege defenses on the militia,
then expand from there.|\s[1]\x[150]...Hmph.|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\wait[5]\s[4]\x[85]Looks like I've offended
yer lady friend.|\s[2]Forget about her.\w[5]
Is there anything else?|\s[4]\x[85]Not really. Patrols'll be sparse.
Troops'll stay bunkered down
until they're directly threatened.|
Scouts out first,\w[5] cavalry for
cleaning, and armor for last resort.\w[10]
Maybe some auxiliaries.|\s[6]\x[130]Auxiliaries?|\s[2]Military-speak for
mercs. Ilian, yeah?|\s[4]\x[85]Probably. The terrain favors
fliers, but you can't exactly
sneak in a dracoknight battalion.|\s[2]Right.\w[5]
That will be all for now.|\s[4]\x[85]Your majesty.|\s[-2]\f[4|nil]\wait[5]\s[6]\x[130]I'll keep an eye
on him, m'lord.|\s[2]Good idea.|\s[-2]\f[6|nil]\wait[35]\f[5|Madelyn]\wait[5]\s[5]\x[150]I want you to know that
I'm strongly opposed to
this, lord Uther.|\s[2]Trust me, I know.|\s[5]\x[150]How dare you take that tone with
me?! That man is a murderer and
a predator,| and I don't care for
you associating with him!|\s[2]I know, Madelyn.| But when
your enemy's only weakness
is pond-scum,| you get down on
your knees and start scooping
up pond-scum.|\s[5]\x[150]...What good is victory
when you turn into what
you're trying to stop?|\s[2]I never did care for
scripture lessons.|\s[5]\x[150]...I can't speak with
you right now.\w[10]
Good evening.|\s[-2]\f[5|nil]\wait[5]\b[2|2]\s[2]Ugh.|</Value>

It would be wise to begin
our attack before the sun
begins to rise.|\s[2]Mm.|
\b[2|0]\w[5]Go round up
the others.|\s[-2]\f[5|nil]\w[5]\s[2]Wait.|\s[-2]\f[5|Hassar]\w[5]\s[2]Could you...\w[5] apologize to
Madelyn for me? She seems to like you.
Maybe she won't spit in your face.|\e[5|1]\s[-2]\wait[30]\f[5|nil]\w[20]</Value>

      <Value>\f[5|Anoleis]\s[5]\x[108]Yaaaawn...|
This is too perfect.
Hey, Sarathi,
don't you agree?|\f[2|Sarathi]\s[2]\x[89]We're occupying another
nation's province by force.|\s[5]\x[108]Well...|\s[2]\x[89]...Hoping to the Living Saint we aren't
discovered and go down in history for
starting the world's most pointless war.|\s[5]\x[108]Yeah, but--|\s[2]\x[89]...For the sole purpose of
helping some spastically-rich
governor monopolize some product|
long enough for him to get even
more insanely rich.|\s[5]\x[108]I don't think--|\s[2]\x[89]...And not only are we being paid
a bare pittance above our usual wage,|
we'll be whisked straight to the gallows
if our commanders ever find out.|
What, I ask, is even slightly
okay with our situation?|\s[5]\x[108]The area's really
pretty at night.|\s[2]\x[89]Ugh.\w[10] I'm returning to my
post before Beck finds out.\w[5]
Stay attentive.|\s[5]\x[108]Yeah, yeah...|</Value>

how glad we all are to see
your pennants. We've been holed|
up here for weeks -\w[10] we were
worried none of our messages
made it.|
We don't know the specifics, but
that force showed up from inside
the castle walls.| They look like
mercenaries, but not very well
organized ones.|
Here, take this gold. For safety's
sake, hit the shops nearby.|
Good luck. We're all counting
on you.|</Value>

morning about cleaning up after
themselves.|
You've got our support. Stomp
those fiends into the dirt and
reclaim the palace!|
Then life can return to normal
around here.|</Value>

      <Value>\f[5|Uther]\f[6|Madelyn]\f[3|Mazda]\f[2|Hassar]\f[1|Magnus]\g[Hill]\s[5]Here's the promised gold,
gents. Thanks again, and
hey -| it's been a pleasure
working with most of you.|\s[3]\x[85]Heh-heh.\w[5]
Fuck you, too.|\s[5]We'll be searching the castle
for prisoners, but you're free
to go if you'd like.|\f[3|nil]\w[10]
...And none too soon.|\s[2]\x[105]We'll go get
a head-start.|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\f[2|nil]\w[10]\f[1|Harken]\f[2|Abelia]\s[2]\x[130]I suppose I shall help.|
Perhaps I can twist the baron's
arm for a feast and a room
before I return to Tania.|\s[1]\x[115]Yeah, I'll...\w[10]
Mm.|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\f[2|nil]\w[10]\f[6|nil]\w[5]\f[2|Madelyn]\s[5]...Subtle, guys.|
Look, Madelyn, I--|\s[2]\x[150]I understand, Uther.
You fight pond-scum
with pond-scum, right?|\s[5]...Right. At the end of the day,
these people can go back to life
as usual, and none of them had|
to be involved in the bloodshed.|\s[2]\x[150]...Every time I think
I understand you...|\s[5]Come on.
Hassar probably
misses you already.|\s[2]\x[150]Uther! Haha...|</Value>
