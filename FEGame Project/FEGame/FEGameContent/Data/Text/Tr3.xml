under the impression you had spent
the week over the Nabatan border,\w[7] and yet,|
Redgrove's maintenance costs are lower
than ever,\w[3] its collections are accounted for,\w[6]
civil unrest is down...|\s[5]\x[100]Your Majesty knows as well as I that
Redgrove is nothing if not autonomous.|
I would go so far as to say that my
meddling could only do her harm.|\s[2]\x[82]Hmph.\w[13] Let us not linger
on the subject.|\s[5]\x[100]...\w[12]As you say.\w[17] Shall we
move on to the business
at hand,\w[7] then?|\s[2]\x[82]Indeed.\w[11] I have studied Master Leonard's
reports at length,\w[6] and though I disapprove
of your conduct, I must applaud your results.|\s[5]\x[100]Thank you,\w[3] Your Eminence.
I am undeserving.|\s[2]\x[82]Nonsense.\w[13] Two months ago,\w[6] we were
unaware an organization such as this
\w[5]"Ring"\w[9] existed.|
Thanks to your efforts,\w[6] we have not only
ousted them from our borders,\w[6] but also
obtained valuable intelligence on their operations.|\s[5]\x[100]I did only what was expected of me.|
Besides,\w[7] fully half of our success can
be attributed to happy coincidence,\w[7] and
Leonard deserves credit for the other half.|\s[2]\x[82]Enough, Uther.\w[17] There is a difference
between humility and misery.|
Just as a commander is responsible for
the failures of his men,\w[7] so too must he
take pride in their success.|\s[5]\x[100]...\w[8]There is truth in that.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]Thank you, Your Majesty.|\s[2]\x[82]Hn.\w[11] I don't see anyone
else sorting you out.|\s[5]\x[100]Heh.|\s[-2]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[100]Well, then,\w[6] have you
considered my proposal?|\s[2]\x[82]Indeed I have,\w[6] and it has cost me
no small amount of sleep.|
An assault on their headquarters
would have been hard to justify while 
they were still occupying Sundale -|
now that they are gone from our lands,\w[11]
such a move is nothing short of absurd.|\s[5]\x[100]You can't truly feel this way...|\s[2]\x[82]Of course not,\w[9] Lord Uther.| These devils
have caused the suffering of many,\w[6] and
will continue to do so for as long as they
remain unchecked...|
But I do not stand at the council table
alone.|\scrollOur fellow lords would argue
that it is foolhardy to risk more lives
when we have already won our safety.|\s[5]\x[100]...\w[14]Our fellow lords,\w[6] you say?|</Value>

Where is Lord Elbert?|\s[6]\x[147]He and his cadre are taking
the Lady Eleanora and young
Lord Eliwood for a ride.|
They should be returning shortly.|\s[5]\x[97]My Lord, may we ask the purpose
of your visit?\w[12] We have only heard
that you were visiting various Marches...|\s[6]\x[147]Sir Marcus figured that we were the
next logical destination from Laus,\w[8] so
he left a runner watching the road for you.|\e[5|3]\s[5]\x[97]L-\w[4]lady Isadora!|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[100]Ha!\w[13] I'm flattered,
Lady Marion.|\s[5]\x[97]...|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[100]It's regarding this criminal organization we uncovered.| 
Father feels the Marquesses would not condone
a strike on their stronghold,\w[7] so I'm convincing

of Darin's precious busts.|\s[5]\x[109]I hope you're joking...|\s[2]\x[100]Mostly.\w[11] I expect I won't need such
drastic measures to persuade you?|\e[2|0]\s[6]\x[78]My Lords,\w[6] if I may?|\s[5]\x[109]Of course, Sir Isaac,\w[7] but for

very loyal to one another,\w[8] and even our most baseborn
stableboy would give his right arm to save a neighbor.|

enemy's p-\w[2]position,\w[7] and that which we
have may be unreliable.| What Master
Leonard was able to give us is as follows:|\scrollThe kingpuh...\w[2] kingpin of the op-\w[2]operation
is a very security-conscious man.|
He commands the entire organization from
this p...\w[2] from this fortress,| and no one enters or
leaves its walls without being p-\w[2]personally
identified by himself or his direct attendants.|\s[6]\x[146]Well,\w[8] we're obviously
not here to sneak in.|\s[2]\x[138]Indeed.\w[12] Lord Uther believes a direct siege
is the best app...\w[2] approach.| They have
well-trained ballisticians in their emp-\w[2]employ,
but only a small handful of the machines.|
The cap-\w[2]captive leader described several
regiments of cavalry,\w[7] elite swordsmen and
ex-Ilian irregulars,\w[9] as well as a robust staff
of support personnel.|\e[4|0]\s[4]\x[95]So,\w[7] what then is the strategy?\w[13]
Charge through the gates and try
to kill more of them than they do us?|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[138]Is not that your sp-\w[2]specialty,\w[8]
Lord Darin?|\e[4|1]\s[4]\x[95]Ha!\w[10] I suppose it is,\w[9]
commander.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[138]It is no secret that this base is incredibly
well-defended,\w[6] and that this mission
has a high likelihood of fatality.|\s[6]\x[146]An optimistic way to consider it is that our
deaths would inspire a more considerable
effort from our respective homelands.|\s[2]\x[138]Er...|\s[4]\x[95]Forget dying,\w[9] I say we
