      <Value>\f[2|Uther]\f[1|Leonard]\f[4|Madelyn]\f[5|Wallace]\f[6|Hassar]\g[Town]\s[2]Thanks again for coming, Lady Madelyn.|\s[4]\x[150]Give it not another thought, m'lord.
Sir Wallace practically begged me for
a chance to... how did you put it?|\s[5]\x[90]I want to stay in practice, ma'am.|\s[4]\x[150]No, you said something much wittier.
What was it?|\s[5]\x[90]...|\s[2]Another time, Madelyn. And Hassar, I
cannot express how fortuitous it was
you and your cadre were visiting Caelin.|\s[6]\x[105]Ah, w-well...|\s[4]\x[150]Hee. What daddy doesn't know...|\s[5]\x[90]Madelyn, please! I don't have much of
a reputation as it stands.|\s[2]Moving on.|\f[4|nil]\f[5|nil]\f[6|nil]\wait[20]\f[4|Cybil]\f[6|Bennet]\s[2]Miss Cybil, always a pleasure.|\s[4]\x[144]I'll take you at your word.|\s[2]I see you've some new fighters with you.
Is Toni occupied elsewhere, then?|\f[5|Fargus]\s[5]\x[90]Ken we skip to th' briefing? I only brought
bourbon enough for 'n hour or two.|\s[2]Of course. Leonard here is
my most capable agent.\w[5]
Leonard, if you would?|\s[1]\x[120]Aye, aye.|\s[-2]\f[2|nil]\wait[20]\m[1|2]\s[2]\x[120]Assuming you dashing fellows are good at
what you do, I don't need to tell you about
Lord Uther's activity during the last Anima.|\s[6]\x[108]The Bernites' occupation of Jennifer, yeah?|\s[4]\x[144]It was an independent operation, you dolt.
Word has it that the ring responsible has
operations all over the continent,|
and they're even screwing their kinsmen
out of their earnings.|\s[2]\x[120]Oh my, you're as sharp in mind as you are
in dress. Now, these guys are well-organized,|
well-funded, and a little too good at hiding
their secrets. Beck was one of their best,|
but he chose poor company. The only reason
we have this lead is because his goons were
sloppy, and we can't expect to get lucky again.|
We play coy with these chaps and the whole
dance floor empties, leaving us with the
fat guy and the one with the weird moustache.|\s[6]\x[108]Uh...|\s[4]\x[144]Let nothing escape or the entire ring
goes into hiding.|\s[6]\x[108]Right.|\s[5]\x[90]Are we sure we've got th' right place?
These folk all look native t' me.|\f[1|Hyde]\s[1]\x[110]Look again, corsair. The militia are local,
but do they seem like the kind of men you
would have guard your peoples?|\s[5]\x[90]Slack-jaws, lard-arses, and incompetents.
Seems like yer standard Lycian
command structure.|\s[1]\x[110]I suggest you get some air, Captain.
You will need to see straight if you
hope to be of use today.|\s[5]\x[90]Hmph.|\s[-2]\f[5|nil]\wait[20]\s[2]\x[120]Intense! Anyway, the more fastidious among
you have probably noticed what our buxom friend
was missing. Patrolmen aren't usually so happy|
with their position, and they're usually not
led by muscle-bound eidolons who're clearly
in their prime.| Our targets stirred the peasants
into a revolt and got themselves a whole army
to take the place with.|\s[4]\x[144]I think I recognize some of these guys...
Real professionals. Remember that hostage
crisis down in Badon?|\s[6]\x[108]Yeah, I'd heard of that...|
A gaggle of pirates tried holding some diplomats
for ransom off the coast. They were feeding the
sharks within the hour.|\s[1]\x[110]And we are to weigh ourselves against
the men responsible?|\s[2]\x[120]If it's too much for you, my dear...|\s[1]\x[110]No. There is no man alive who might divert
my course. I have come here to complete a task,
and complete it I shall.|\s[4]\x[144]Right, your mark. I'd almost forgotten.|\s[2]\x[120]Hmmmm?|\s[4]\x[144]The good inquisitor agreed to aid us on the
terms that we not interfere with his work.|
One of his flock has escaped and submerged
himself in Sundale.|\s[-2]\f[5|Magnus]\s[5]\x[95]And we have the time to
seek missing altar boys.|\s[1]\x[110]Mark my words, ruffian. The prisoner I seek
is one of the most dangerous beasts you will
ever have the displeasure of knowing.|
For so long as he may enact his will, every
kingdom in our land lies on the cusp of ruin.
He is a mastermind, a warrior, and a demon.|
This rebellion of yours hardly sizes up.|\s[5]\x[95]...I stand corrected.|\s[2]\x[120]Don't mess yourself, child. We'll find your boy,
but we've got other things to work out first.|\s[1]\x[110]Very well.|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\f[5|nil]\s[4]\x[144]Fargus!|\s[-2]\f[5|Fargus]\s[4]\x[144]Let's hear it, then.|\s[2]\x[120]The turncoats shouldn't prove too dangerous.
They've got the backing of a raided Pheraen
treasury in their favor, but none of the training.|
The local pirates seem to have struck
a deal, and have been stripping the town
periodically since the lawmen were slain.|
It's likely they'll be called to action
when we begin. It's the Ring's men we
need to watch for, though.|
You'll pick them on sight; armed to the teeth,
vicious as wild dogs, and as cold as the steel
that protects them.|
We'll need to make full use of the assets
Lady Madelyn brought, yes sir.|\s[4]\x[144]Bennet, map.|\s[6]\x[108]Aye.|\s[4]\x[144]We enter from the west?|\s[2]\x[120]Right. They've abandoned this side of the city
to rioters, so we'll find no opposition until
we're practically inside the castle's walls.|
They'll be fiercely guarding this series of
bridges, here -\w[15] the only access to the castle
gates. We'll be staving off rebels, mercenaries,|
pirates, and if I'm not mistaken,
a wing of dracoknights.|\s[5]\x[90]Not th' only way in.|\s[2]\x[120]Well, of course. You can challenge the
pirates on their territory, but it's a
long swim to the south cape.|\s[4]\x[144]And we don't really have the time.|\s[5]\x[90]Just sayin'.|\s[2]\x[120]We'll see what happens. Our main focus is
the villa -\w[10] there's probably a few locals
still trapped in the chaos who'd be grateful|
for a way out. I'm familiar with the local
alchemist -\w[10] she's pretty stubborn, so she's
probably still running salves to those who remain.|
We might be able to make use of her wares.
I've a few other "friends" who used to operate from
here, but I doubt they'd still be hanging around.|\s[6]\x[108]What about inside?|\s[2]\x[120]I don't know. The men running this operation
are sharper than anyone I've ever crossed.
All I can tell you is that the padfoots I sent|
in were charred beyond recognition when they
were pulled from the sea.|\s[4]\x[144]Pah. A sage is the last thing we need.|\s[2]\x[120]These men would have put slip to a sage, dear.
This was something far swifter and far fiercer.|</Value>

of us survived, and we weren't sure we'd
make it through another cold night.|
I'll give you the short version. We were
changing shifts. Familiar men emerged from
the darkness, offering ale and rest for|
tired feet. They took our hands and then
lunged with their daggers. We lost half
our men in that first moment.| The alarm
went up, and the wallmen assembled. Each
archer took his post, prepared his bow,|
and was knocked down in turn by an
unseen sharpshooter. We footmen were
mobilized.| We charged into the darkness
only to be blinded by sharp pulses
of light.|\scrollSuddenly there were only ten men guarding
Sundale.| We choked on the smell of burnt
hair and were shocked by the touch of our
very own armor.\w[5] We were undone.|\scrollNow, here we are. No matter how many men
you bring with you, just remember to

No, listen, Longbowmen are a unique
breed of Archer. Unless you've a
specialized weapon, or a marksman with|
similar training, you'll find your own
arrows falling short while theirs sail
over your head.|
I can't explain how they shoot so far,
but I can offer some advice...
Be mindful of their abilities.|
Try to bait them with someone sturdy
before you go making a bad decision.|

have to avoid them entirely!|
