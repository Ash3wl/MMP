\f[5|Uther]
Five months after the Etrurian border conflict,\w[5] it is still the\n
only thing on the lips of the commons. Talks of Uther's|\n
valor and of his ruthlessness are in equal popularity,\w[4] though\n
the lord himself wishes they would speak of anything else.|\n
Anything at all.|\f[5|nil]\scroll

-Key: Tr1-2-
Thusly,\w[5] when a rider from Tania brings word of a new threat,|

Uther leaps at the chance to put spur to flank and be rid of\n

\f[2|Uther]
After the liberation of Jennifer,\w[5] Uther's team discover a cache\n
of incriminating documents in Beck's makeshift study.|\n
These papers suggest a possible conspiracy,\w[7] a network\n
of criminal outfits who control the ebb and flow of the Lycian|\n
market by suppressing competition and increasing demand.|\f[2|nil]\scroll

-Key: Tr2-2-
To confirm these suspicions,\w[5] Uther brings the documents to\n
his father,|

 who then sets his spies to work chasing the ghostly\n
trail of these expert con artists.|

When a lead turns up in Sundale,\w[6] Uther is soon on his\n
steed,\w[5] eager to put the stink of Ostia behind him again.|

Corruption had rooted deep in Lycia,\w[6] with its tendrils choking\n
the life from great cities and humble baileys alike.|

-Key: Tr3-2-
 Not so deep\n
that it could not be cut out, however,\w[8] and cut it out Uther did,|\n
and cauterized it with fire for good measure.|

-Key: Tr3-3-
\n
The campaign took weeks,\w[6] for the criminals would fade away like\n
mist and spring forth again in places he had already cleansed;|\w[5]\n
but Uther was not a man known for giving up easily.|

-Key: Tr3-4-
\n
Through bloodshed and bribery he found each villain in turn\n
and in turn he gave them their just dues.|\scroll

-Key: Tr3-5-
\f[2|Uther]
It soon became clear that the scope of this treachery was far\n
greater than anyone had anticipated.|

-Key: Tr3-6-
 After touching base\n
with their foreign contacts,\f[5|Eiry]\w[7] Uther and his allies find evidence|\n
of operations all across the dark continent.|\f[5|nil]

-Key: Tr3-7-
\n
Acting quickly,\f[5|Leonard]\w[6] Uther and Leonard draw up a plan to strike\n
at all of the Ring's major power bases at once...|

The turncoats shouldn't prove too dangerous.\n
They've got the backing of a raided Pheraen\n
treasury in their favor, but none of the training.|\n
The local pirates seem to have struck\n
a deal, and have been stripping the town\n
periodically since the lawmen were slain.|\n
It's likely they'll be called to action\n
when we begin. It's the Ring's men we\n
need to watch for, though.|\n
You'll pick them on sight; armed to the teeth,\n
vicious as wild dogs, and as cold as the steel\n
that protects them.|\n
We'll need to make full use of the assets\n
Lady Madelyn brought, yes sir.|

# Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
Right. They've abandoned this side of the city\n
to rioters, so we'll find no opposition until\n
we're practically inside the castle's walls.|\n
They'll be fiercely guarding this series of\n
bridges, here -\w[15] the only access to the castle\n
gates. We'll be staving off rebels, mercenaries,|\n
pirates, and if I'm not mistaken,\n
a wing of dracoknights.|
# Fargus

Well, of course. You can challenge the\n

Just sayin'.|

We'll see what happens. Our main focus is\n
the villa -\w[10] there's probably a few locals\n
still trapped in the chaos who'd be grateful|\n
for a way out. I'm familiar with the local\n
alchemist -\w[10] she's pretty stubborn, so she's\n
probably still running salves to those who remain.|\n
We might be able to make use of her wares.\n
I've a few other "friends" who used to operate from\n
here, but I doubt they'd still be hanging around.|
# Bennet
\s[6]\x[108]
What about inside?|
# Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
I don't know. The men running this operation\n
are sharper than anyone I've ever crossed.\n
All I can tell you is that the padfoots I sent|\n
in were charred beyond recognition when they\n
were pulled from the sea.|
# Cybil

We're from the local garrison. Only the six\n
of us survived, and we weren't sure we'd\n
make it through another cold night.|\n
I'll give you the short version. We were\n
changing shifts. Familiar men emerged from\n
the darkness, offering ale and rest for|\n
tired feet. They took our hands and then\n
lunged with their daggers. We lost half\n
our men in that first moment.| The alarm\n
went up, and the wallmen assembled. Each\n
archer took his post, prepared his bow,|\n
and was knocked down in turn by an\n
unseen sharpshooter. We footmen were\n
mobilized.| We charged into the darkness\n
only to be blinded by sharp pulses\n
of light.|\scroll

Suddenly there were only ten men guarding\n
Sundale.| We choked on the smell of burnt\n
hair and were shocked by the touch of our\n
very own armor.\w[5] We were undone.|\scroll

Now, here we are. No matter how many men\n
you bring with you, just remember to\n
look up, lest you lose them all.|

No, listen, Longbowmen are a unique\n
breed of Archer. Unless you've a\n

similar training, you'll find your own\n
arrows falling short while theirs sail\n
over your head.|\n
I can't explain how they shoot so far,\n

Be mindful of their abilities.|\n
Try to bait them with someone sturdy\n
before you go making a bad decision.|\n

have to avoid them entirely!|\n

You confound me, Lord Uther.\w[15] I was\n
under the impression you had spent\n
the week over the Nabatan border,\w[7] and yet,|\n
Redgrove's maintenance costs are lower\n
than ever,\w[3] its collections are accounted for,\w[6]\n
civil unrest is down...|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
Your Majesty knows as well as I that\n
Redgrove is nothing if not autonomous.|\n
I would go so far as to say that my\n
meddling could only do her harm.|

Hmph.\w[13] Let us not linger\n
on the subject.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]

move on to the business\n
at hand,\w[7] then?|
#Ulric
\s[2]\x[82]
Indeed.\w[11] I have studied Master Leonard's\n
reports at length,\w[6] and though I disapprove\n
of your conduct, I must applaud your results.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
Thank you,\w[3] Your Eminence.\n
I am undeserving.|
#Ulric
\s[2]\x[82]
Nonsense.\w[13] Two months ago,\w[6] we were\n
unaware an organization such as this\n
\w[5]"Ring"\w[9] existed.|\n
Thanks to your efforts,\w[6] we have not only\n
ousted them from our borders,\w[6] but also\n
obtained valuable intelligence on their operations.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
I did only what was expected of me.|\n
Besides,\w[7] fully half of our success can\n
be attributed to happy coincidence,\w[7] and\n
Leonard deserves credit for the other half.|
#Ulric
\s[2]\x[82]
Enough, Uther.\w[17] There is a difference\n
between humility and misery.|\n
Just as a commander is responsible for\n
the failures of his men,\w[7] so too must he\n
take pride in their success.|

Indeed I have,\w[6] and it has cost me\n
no small amount of sleep.|\n
An assault on their headquarters\n
would have been hard to justify while \n
they were still occupying Sundale -|\n
now that they are gone from our lands,\w[11]\n
such a move is nothing short of absurd.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
You can't truly feel this way...|
#Ulric
\s[2]\x[82]
Of course not,\w[9] Lord Uther.| These devils\n
have caused the suffering of many,\w[6] and\n
will continue to do so for as long as they\n
remain unchecked...|\n
But I do not stand at the council table\n
alone.|\scroll
Our fellow lords would argue\n
that it is foolhardy to risk more lives\n
when we have already won our safety.|

And what's the\n
problem with that?|
#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
To begin with,\w[6] locking yourself in a box\n
leaves you trapped.\w[14] If an enemy elects\n
not to storm your gates,\w[5] so to speak,|\n
you will be forced to either starve to death\n
or abandon it.\w[16] You need an escape route.|\n
Such positions also offer little visibility.\w[15] You\n
need windows,\w[5] or a watchtower,\w[5] some way\n
to keep an eye on all directions of approach.|\n
Windows also help in the case of a\n

#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
Any noble of sufficient power is going\n
to be invited to this dance at some point,\w[7]\n
Uther,\w[7] so it's best we prepare you for it.|\n
Even the likes of Elbert will face such\n
scandals before his day is done.|
#Uther angry

#Leonard normal
\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[120]
That's the point,\w[6] Uther,\w[6] you don't need one.\w[16]\n
If someone wants to blackmail you,\w[5] half\n
of the time they'll just make something up.|\n
Even if it's an outrageous lie,\w[6] people will keep\n
talking about it,\w[6] and soon it will be only thing\n
anyone thinks of when they hear your name.|\n
\e[5|0]The answer is not to be unassailable,\w[6]\n
because that's impossible.\w[15] Rather,\w[6] you\n
need to be ready with a counter-attack.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
You mean blackmail them back?|
#Leonard normal
\s[2]\x[120]
Precisely.\w[15] It's a concept known as\n
"mutually assured destruction".\w[18] If you\n
take me down,\w[6] I take you down too.|\n
The problem then becomes finding\n
out who is doing it,\w[7] and what their\n
motive is,\w[7] and so on.|\n
You must weigh the cost of their\n
attack against what you can do.\w[16]\n
It gets complicated very quickly.|

#Leonard

#Uther closes eyes
\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[100]
Oh,\w[6] gods...|
#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
The importance of scheming while in power.|\n
\b[5|0]Just like you need to run weapon drills and\n
practice the melee in tourneys,\w[6] you need\n
to keep your political skills sharp as well.|\n
You can consider the local infighting and\n
backstabbing that is part of our proud\n
Lycian heritage a sort of training ground.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
You make light of it,\w[6] but lives are\n
lost in those squabbles.\w[16] I would\n
rather not be part of that.|
#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
Be that as it may,\w[7] they are going\n
to happen with or without you.|\n
And if you win them,\w[6] you can keep\n
the bloodshed to a minimum.|\n
Besides,\w[6] if you do abstain from such\n
things,\w[7] you will be unprepared when\n
Bern or Etruria move against you.|\n
How many lives will be lost then,\w[7] hm?|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
...I cannot deny\n
the truth of that.|
#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
And they will move against you if they see\n
that you cannot control the Marquesses.|\n
Your father knows this well.\w[18] He has spent\n
the better part of twenty years asserting\n
himself over them in this matter,\w[6] or that.|\n
It is not about the individual victories,\w[6] but\n
about appearing strong to his adversaries.|
#Uther
\s[5]\x[100]
Okay,\w[6] Leonard.\w[12] I get it.\w[15] So what sort\n
of schemes are we talking about here?\w[18]\n
Should I be blackmailing and kidnapping?|
#Leonard
\s[2]\x[120]
Nothing so vulgar as that.\w[19] But you must control\n
who gets placed in office,\w[6] which lords are at\n
odds and which are allies,\w[6] how the public feels|\n
about various policies...\w[24]\n
Sometimes you will have to set yourself up as\n
the villain so that one of your pawns can be the|\n
hero,\w[6] and sometimes you will have to sacrifice\n
them so that you can be beloved again.|\n
\e[2|3]\b[2|1]It is a dangerous game,\w[6] and one you\n
will be playing for the remainder of your\n
short and terrifying life.|

and I am most honored to have done so.|\n
To have access to the lord's chambers,\w[6] to see\n
him at his most vulnerable,\w[6] to be privy to the\n
contents of his letters and private discussions...|\n
\b[5|2]Aye,\w[6] it is an intimate thing indeed.|

#Marcus

Conan's manual,\w[5] am I correct?|
#Augustus

I am.|
#Marcus
\s[2]\x[97]
Yes,\w[6] I thought so.\w[19] And I can see\n
that you have modified them to\n
suit your own tastes...|\n
Those are 9th century pallisades,\w[6]\n
yes?\w[16] Highly advanced for their\n
time.\w[20] A good choice,\w[6] sir.|
#Augustus

Thank you...|
#Marcus closes eyes
\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[97]
However,\w[6] much has changed since\n
Conan's day.\w[16] Ilian crossbows are now\n
more common among mercenary troops,|\n
and draco riders are now hiring out.|\n
The leading orders of Lycian knights\n
have also been developing their lance\n
techniques to adapt to these changes...|

Tell me,\w[6] Sergeant Major,\w[6] in your time\n
as an attendant to Lord Grayson,\w[6] did\n
you accompany him on his hunts?|
#Augustus
\s[5]\x[101]
Of course.\w[16] I was only a common lad,\w[6] but\n
my mother had taught me all the things\n
a noble boy would be expected to learn:|\n
literacy,\w[6] astronomy,\w[6] arithmetic...|\n
So,\w[6] when I finished my duties for the day,\w[6]\n
I was permitted to join the other boys for\n
their lessons in riding and hawking.|
#Marcus

#Augustus squints
\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[101]
To a certain extent,\w[6] yes.\w[19]\b[5|0] I never had much\n
of a stomach for the kill,\w[6] but racing through|\n
the woods with the dogs barking and the\n
horns blaring was always a thrill.|\n
It was a good way to see the countryside,\w[6]\n
besides,\w[6] and gave me opportunity to pick\n
flowers to decorate my lord's bedchamber.|
#Marcus smiles
\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[97]
How thoughtful of you.\w[19]\b[2|0] What of husbandry?|\n
My father was very keen on breeding,\w[6] for\n
he felt a knight should raise his own steed\n
as he should forge his own sword.|\n
But I understand that many noblemen\n
consider such things beneath them,\w[6] and\n
leave them to the artisans.|
#Augustus
\s[5]\x[101]
Aye,\w[6] that was the way of it with\n
Lord Grayson.\w[19] He was not a man\n
who liked to dirty his hands.|\n
Except when it came to butchering\n
his game.\w[17]\b[5|1] He seemed to take\n
pleasure in that...|

Sorry,\w[5] ma'am.\w[16]\b[2|0] I've been reflecting\n

about the vows I must take...|
#Abelia normal, opens eyes
\b[5|0]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]
Ah.\w[19] Yes,\w[5] the oath is quite dire\n
in its wording,\w[5] is it not?|\n
\b[5|1]"I so swear to forego the pleasures\n
of my mortal life,\w[5] and live only as a\n
vessel to the spirit of the Saint..."|

I-indeed.|
#Abelia looks up

You're not the first one to be\n
daunted by those words,\w[5] lass.\w[18]\n
That's the purpose of them.|\n
There are a hundred thousand little boys\n
out there growing up with dreams of\n
slaying dragons and saving princesses -|\n
of riding back to their dirt-poor village in\n
their shining armor and smiling smugly\n
down at those who picked on them.|\n
It's an easy thing to become a page,\w[5]\n
after all,\w[5] and there's always work for a\n
decent squire...| But when it comes time\n
to say the words,\w[5] to give up everything\n
for the sake of ideals and servitude...|\n
\e[5|1]Well,\w[6] that's when we find out who is just\n
a dreamer and who has the real steel.|
#Isadora squints
\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]

#Abelia normal
\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]
Try not to dwell on it.\w[14] It will only distract\n
you from your training.\w[18] When the time\n
comes,\w[5] you'll know what your answer is.|\n
And until then,\w[5] you're picking up skills that\n
will be useful in a dozen different fields.|

I had something of an unfair advantage\n
over many other knights.\w[16] I did not have\n
a mortal life to give up,\w[5] you see.|\scroll
I was betrothed to wed the Marquess of\n
Araphen,\w[5] but he first insisted a diviner do\n
a reading on my womb to gauge my fertility.|\n
Not one,\w[5] but three different seers gave me\n
the same result:\w[12] I would never bear a child.|\n
For the sake of diplomacy,\w[5] my father sent\n
me to the local monastery,\w[5] where I spent\n
a long time grieving...\w[19]\e[5|1] Until I found escape...|
#Isadora
\s[2]\x[152]
You would become a knight!|
#Abelia normal
\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]
It was a long,\w[4] hard road,\w[6] but I fought my\n
way into the temple guard,\w[5] and from there,\w[5]\n
distinguished myself through acts of valor.|\n
Before long,\w[5] my father had no choice but to\n
officially recognize my worth:\w[12] the church,\w[5] the\n
commons,\w[5] even other lords were demanding it.|\scroll
In the end,\w[5] I had to work much harder\n
than your average knight,\w[6] but I had no\n
life to give up.\w[16] This was my only path.|
#Isadora smiles

Aye,\w[6] there are petty pleasures to be had,\w[4]\n
as well.\w[19]\b[2|0] Among my favorites is how\n
everyone in your road will make way.|\n
You can be riding up the highway or\n
walking down an aisle -| when folk see\n
you coming,\w[5] they drop all their squabbles\n
and work as one to clear a path.|
#Isadora smiles
\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]
Heh.|
#Abelia
\s[2]\x[130]
There are many such little things that\n
come from the prestige of knighthood.|\n
Others will let you speak your mind,\w[5]\n
without you needing to raise your voice.|\n
Strangers will rush to help you dismount\n
and give up their beds for you.\w[18] Balding\n
priests will give their blessings,\w[5] blushing|\n
maids will offer tokens of luck,\w[5] restless\n
guards will ride escort to the border...|\scroll

\e[2|1]But it gets very close sometimes.|
#Isadora smiles
\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]
I see.\w[17] You make it sound\n
very glamorous.|
#Abelia
\s[2]\x[130]
It can be.\w[15] But I think the best\n
pleasures are the quiet ones...|\scroll
\b[2|1]When you arrive at your estate,\w[6]\n
the sun setting,| and you can\n
barely make out the coat of arms\n
on the banners over your door...|\n
But you know it's there,\w[6] and it's\n
yours,\w[6] and you swell with pride.|\scroll
The stable is empty,\w[6] as the staff\n
don't yet know you're back,\w[6] and you|\n
have the chance to stable your\n
own horse without a dozen\n
grooms fighting to impress you...|\n
\b[2|0]And you make a mess of it\n
because it's been so long\n
since you did it for yourself...|\scroll
\b[2|1]You ease yourself into the bath,\w[5]\n
and feel the ache of a long\n
campaign slowly fade to memory...|\n
\b[2|2]And for a little while,\w[6] forget that\n
you are even a knight at all...|
#Isadora squints
\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]
How lovely...|\scroll

#Madelyn smiles

I did,\w[6] actually.\w[12] It was of poor quality,\w[5] with\n

your father was much like yourself.|

He was very...\w[10]\b[2|1] Hm...|\n
\b[2|0]Tactless...?|\scroll
\b[5|0]Frankly,\w[5] my lady,\w[5] he was very much\n
concerned with his own comforts\n
over matters of politics and formality.|\n
He would say whatever he wished,\w[5]\n
shirk his duties to go hunting,\w[5] even\n
threaten those who impeded his fun.|\n
Of course,\w[6] he was well-loved by the\n
townspeople,\w[6] for he was often among\n
them throwing feasts and parties.|

\s[2]\x[85]
Even as young men,\w[6] your father\n
and his brother were often at odds.|\n
Master Lundgren was studious,\w[5] and\n
responsible,\w[5] and always insisted that\n
he should be made the heir instead.|\n
Yet,\w[5] at the same time,\w[5] he was quite\n
jealous of your father's adventures,\w[5]\n
and would sometimes try to mimic him.|\n
He would only injure himself,\w[6] or offend\n
someone with one of his attempted jokes,\w[6]\n
and never really enjoyed himself anyway.|\n
\e[5|0]So,\w[6] jealousy rooted deeper and deeper...|
#Madelyn
\s[5]\x[150]

#Eagler

They loved each other,\w[6] however,\w[6] and\n
Lord Hausen would eventually begin to\n
make efforts to include him where he could...|\n
But by that time,\w[6] he was preparing for his\n
coronation,\w[6] and had no time for such follies,\w[6]\n

Hmm...\w[16] I do like to ride,\w[6] but it is\n
difficult to enjoy when my friends\n

When I am scouting for the enemy,\w[7]\n
or riding in battle,\w[6] I am full of tension\n

making a good pace with nothing on\n

\e[2|2]When I am mixing and pouring,\w[6]\n
I will become cross and shout\n
at my utensils,| and when it is on\n
the stove,\w[6] I will pace and fret...|\n
\e[2|1]But when it is on the platter,\w[6] and\n
I have the flowers arranged just so,\w[8]\n
why,\w[5]\m[2|2] nothing makes me happier!|
#Hassar smiles
\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[105]
I am fond of cooking,\w[6] as well.\w[15]\n
When I was young,\w[6] my mother taught\n
me to collect herbs for medicine,\w[6] and|\n
she showed me which ones were good\n
for this dish or that one.\w[15] I have tried\n
to stay in practice ever since.|
#Madelyn

Why are you watching me,\w[6]\n
you strange,\w[6] little man?|
#Roeis
\s[5]\x[130]
Was there ever a better way to die?\w[16]\n
\x[80]That's all living is,\w[6] after all.\w[12] Dying by\n
pieces with each exhaled breath.|
#Madelyn normal
\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[150]
That's a sad way to look at things.|\n
If we do,\w[3] indeed,\w[3] die with each day,\w[6]\n
then I choose to believe we are also\n
born with each waking.|\n
Then we get to live a million lives!|
#Roeis sad
\e[5|3]\s[5]\x[80]
What are a million lives but a million\n
ways to suffer heartbreak and tragedy?|
#Madelyn smiles
\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[150]
A million ways to laugh,\w[6]\n

\b[2|2]Try as you like,\w[5] creature,\w[5] you\n
simply cannot spoil my mood.|
#Roeis normal
\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[80]
That is for the best.\w[16] I can only truly\n
appreciate my misery when I can\n
compare it to your tyrannical hope.|

You are a spiteful thing,\w[6] are you not?\w[16]\n
I wonder,\w[4] what made you so broken?|
#Roeis
\s[5]\x[80]
Who says I am broken?\w[16]\x[130] This is the natural\n
state of all things,\w[6] and you will mature into\n
what I am when time heals your wounds.|
#Madelyn
\s[2]\x[150]
Hmmmm.\w[14] No,\w[5] I don't believe that at all.\w[14]\n
\e[2|1]\b[2|2]For the fact that I exist as I am is proof\n
enough that this is how I was meant to be.|\n
If I were supposed to be any other way,\w[6]\n
I would be that way,\w[5] instead of how I am.|
#Roeis squints
\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[80]
As I said.\w[15] You are a\n

#Madelyn
\s[2]\x[150]
And so I told him,\w[6] there is simply no way!\w[18]\n
The moss is too slippery,\w[6] and all you will\n
gain for your efforts is a bruised bottom.|\n
But he was certain that if he got himself\n
a good running start,\w[6] he could scramble\n
to the top with his momentum alone.|

\b[2|0]Don't interrupt.|\scroll
\b[2|2]So I stood back and watched him pace\n
out fifty feet,\w[5] and I told him again that he\n
was letting his pride get the better of him.|\n
He said that I would soon be eating my\n
words,\w[5] and began to run.\w[14] No sooner had\n
he put his first foot on the wall did he slip.|\n
All his momentum did for him was dash his\n
face against the wall,\w[6] and sure enough his\n
nose went straight out the back of his head.|

\b[2|0]I am offended you would say such a thing.|\n
It punched right through his skull and flew\n
across the yard,\w[6] and a crow plucked it out\n
of the air and carried it off.|
#Roeis angry
\e[5|2]\s[5]\x[80]
That is the most ridiculous...\wait[20]\n

#Madelyn smiles, jumps
\e[2|1]\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[150]
That's the spirit!\w[15] You should have heard him\n
cry like a child,\w[5] clutching at his mangled face.|\n
\e[2|0]\b[2|2]He fell to his knees and repented for not\n
believing me,\w[5] for saying that I was foolish.|\n
I touched him once with my staff,\w[5] and mended\n
him,\w[5] and he kissed my feet in thanks.\w[14] He\n
swore to build a castle in my honor...|
#Roeis turns

My father would say,\w[5] "Lorca children\n
learn to run before they learn to walk,"\w[5]\n
and it was as good as the truth.|\n
Once a child started running,\w[5] they would\n
not stop again until it was supper -\w[9] and\n

Even our rite of adulthood is about\n
running.| We are sent out into the\n
plains to catch a horse,\w[5] spring on\n
its back,\w[5] and ride it until it submits.|\n
If you are thrown,\w[5] you must chase\n
down that same horse and keep\n
trying until it is yours.\w[18] Udosi led me|\n

\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[148]
Now,\w[6] then.\w[18] So far,\w[6] I have been teaching you\n
to cast from rote,\w[5] which is a fine thing if you\n
want stable,\w[5] well-formed spells.| The standard\n
incantations have been perfected over the\n
course of centuries,| and using them allows\n
you to harness the expertise and knowledge\n
of all the wizards who came before you.|\n
However,\w[5] firing off someone else's fireballs\n
like a glorified onager will get you only so far.|\n
To ascend to the next level,\w[5] you must come\n
to understand what the words themselves\n
mean,\w[5] and how to structure a spell.|\n
\b[2|0]Can you think of any situations where it\n
would benefit you to know such things?|
#Magnus squints
\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[95]
I suppose...\w[12]\b[5|0] If I wanted to modify a spell,\w[5]\n
to make it behave differently?\w[19] Say,\w[5] to\n
make a blade of wind blow hot or cold...|\n
Or to make a fireball tight and focused,\w[5]\n
in order to reduce collateral damage.|
#Eiry squints
\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]
...\w[4]Those are the exact examples used\n
in a remedial spellcraft class.\w[16] Have you\n
been doing extracurricular research?|
#Magnus
\s[5]\x[95]
No,\w[5] boss,\w[5] it just...\w[11]\n
makes sense.|
#Eiry
\s[2]\x[148]
Hmmm...\wait[21]\b[2|2] Well,\w[5] I would applaud you\n
for doing so,\w[5] if such were the case.|\n
As your teacher,\w[6] I do want to stay\n
informed of your progress,| but that\n
does not mean I am unwilling to let\n
you seek lessons of others.|
#Magnus
\s[5]\x[95]
I--|
#Eiry angry, squints
\e[2|2]\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]
Unless it were the likes of that dullard\n
Professor White,\w[6] whose witless ramblings\n
would only harm what I have done.|
#Magnus
\s[5]\x[95]
...|
#Eiry looks up
\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]
But as you said,\w[6] you naturally\n
came to that conclusion of\n
your own reasoning.|
#Magnus
\s[5]\x[95]
...Indeed.|
#Eiry normal
\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]
Very well.|\scroll
\b[2|2]Yes,\w[6] those are ways in which an understanding\n
of spellcraft can be applied.| However,\w[7] getting\n
the syntax of the language correct and ensuring\n
the spell's overall arrangement of elements is|\n
cohesive is of utmost importance,\w[9] for otherwise\n
the casting of it could have disastrous results.|\n
It is theoretically possible to write a new spell\n
from whole cloth with a complete understanding\n
of the language,| but to acquire such knowledge\n
one would need to live for centuries...|
#Magnus squints
\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[95]
(...Was it Professor White,\w[6] or...\w[12]\n
...Blake?\w[15] ...Heights?\w[15] He did\n
seem something of a dullard...)|
#Eiry angry
\e[2|2]\s[2]\x[148]
Which is why it is so important that\n
a student of such advanced age\n
work that much harder to master it.|\n
\m[2|2]\b[2|0]Tell me,\w[6] Magnus,\w[6] what is the\n
cardinal element of magic?|
#Magnus looks up

#Magnus

So...\w[19] You're saying that all\n
magic is based on life-force?|
#Eiry closes eyes
\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]
No,\w[7] Magnus.\w[19] That is a gross oversimplification\n
of the concept.\w[16]\b[5|0] It is clear now that you have\n
been poisoned by the meddling of lesser minds.|
#Magnus squints
\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[95]
(Damn you,\w[6] Professor White...)|
#Eiry
\s[5]\x[148]
There is a power,\w[6]\b[2|0] called by some "energy"\n
and by some "mana" that permeates every\n
physical thing in this world.\w[21] Yes,\w[4] it is true|\n
that living creatures are possessed of it,\w[7]\n
but so too are the minerals in the earth\n
and the light that pours down from the sky.|\n
It is what gives an object its weight,\w[6] what\n
binds it together,\w[6] what allows it to be\n
transformed from one thing to another.|\n
When you cast a spell,\w[6] you are giving a\n
sequence of commands to the energy of\n
the things around you.| You can use it to\n
change the shape of a thing,\w[6] or move it,\w[6]\n
or transfer its energy to another object.|\n
Today,\w[7] I want you to forego the use of\n
incantations and try to manipulate this\n
energy by feel and force of will.|
#Magnus
\s[2]\x[95]
What,\w[6] just...\w[11] wish for\n

#Eiry angry, closes eyes
\e[5|2]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]
...\w[9]You are being facetious,\w[7] but yes,\w[7]\n

\b[5|0]Recall times in the past that you have\n
summoned one using an incantation,\w[6]\n
and try to feel those same sensations.|

#Magnus

A prickling heat in my bones...|\n
static under my skin...|\n
fluttering wings in my stomach...|\scroll
But I am feeling these things at once\n
within my body and outside of it,\w[6] as if...\w[17]\n
my body were the world itself...|
#Eiry
\s[5]\x[148]
...Truly?\w[19]\b[5|1]\n
So quickly...?|
#Magnus
\s[2]\x[95]
I've...\w[11]\b[5|0] I've always been aware of\n
it when I cast before,\w[8] anyway...|\n
\b[2|1]I sort of just...\w[9] mumbled the lines\n
without thinking about them,| and\n
focused my attention on the surge\n
of heat and the sudden release...|
#Eiry
\s[5]\x[148]
Interesting...\w[21] A surly,\w[5] level-headed\n
pragmatist like yourself...\w[14] I had thought\n
reason would be the best path for you.|\n
\e[5|1]But it seems,\w[6] underneath,\w[6] you\n
are quite the emotional fellow.|
#Magnus
\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[95]
Phew.\w[11] I'm exhausted.\w[16]\n
And no fireballs,\w[6] it seems.|
#Eiry normal
\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]
Of course not.\w[17] Casting without a tome\n
is impossible,\w[6] or at least,\w[6] it has been\n
since the so-called "Ending Winter".|\n
The purpose of this exercise was to\n
heighten your awareness of the ambient\n
energy around you.\w[16] Such is the fuel that|\n
powers your Anima magic,\w[5] and being able\n
to find rich sources of it and sense when\n
your enemy is manipulating it will be vital.|
#Magnus
\s[2]\x[95]
I get it.\w[18] And when I am bending the\n
elements,\w[6] I will be able to feel the flow\n
of energy and correct malformations,|\n
instead of needing to pay such close\n
heed to my arcane grammar.|
#Eiry smiles, closes eyes
\e[5|1]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]
Precisely.\w[19] Very good,\w[5] Magnus.|\n
You are mastering this with remarkable\n
ease -\w[10] and it is certain you could not\n
have heard THAT from Professor White.|

And he was humiliated when the wider\n
magical community read my manifesto\n

spells without using a tome?|
#Eiry
\s[2]\x[148]
To change the world from one way to\n
another,\w[6] rewriting the rules of life itself...|\n
That is no simple matter,\w[6] and takes a\n
great amount of power to even attempt.|\n
So,\w[6] spell tomes are written on rare and\n
ancient parchment,\w[6] using magical ink\n
made of spirit dust and silver ore.|

You told me.\w[16] The mana of these materials\n
is consumed,\w[6] beginning a chain reaction\n
that carries words and gives them power.|
#Eiry
\s[2]\x[148]
Correct.\w[16] But a counterspell is just telling\n
the world to snap back to its natural form.|\n
With so much mana already in motion,\w[6] it\n
is a simple thing to neutralize a spell and\n
return things to a state of calm.|
#Magnus
\s[5]\x[95]
If it's so simple,\w[6] how does anyone\n
ever succeed in casting at all?|
#Eiry

There are many ways.\w[19] Words of power.\w[15]\n
Glyphs,\w[6] wards,\w[6] and sigils.\w[15] Animal sacrifice.|\n
It is said that the elder druids of Sacae merge\n
their will with that of the cosmos,\w[6] so that the\n
natural state of things is whatever they wish.|\n

finish your incantation before they can\n
their counterspell works adequately.|\scroll
\b[2|0]\e[2|0]In the end,\w[6] this is why I taught you to know\n
both the logic and the heart of spellcasting.|\n

In the manner of,\w[6] for instance,\w[6] your Sorceror-\n

#Eiry
\s[5]\x[148]
Indeed.\w[12] Much like his father Duke Ulric's\n
violent seizure of the March of Araphen\n
from its ruling house some twelve years ago.|\n
\b[5|1]Or perhaps,\w[6] more recently,\w[6] like his very\n
own trespass in Laus,\w[6] where he bullied\n
his way through the local militia.|

Anyway, this world contains many features you\n
may recognize from FE7x, so watch out!\wait[10]\n
(If you haven't played FE7x, you should.)|
\scroll
For example, most weapons have +2 might\n
compared to what you're used to from FEGBA.\n
Also, you can hold 6 items.|\n
Bows get WTA at 2 range and WTD at 1 range,\n
and if you don't have any equipped weapons,\n
you always get WTD!|\n
Something cool you can do is, if you talk to\n
someone, you can still perform other actions, so\n
don't hesitate to stop by and chat!|\n
A couple units have skills that affect their\n
movement which are somewhat buggy. If they\n
act up, just suspend and resume.|\n
There's no permadeath, but do mind your weapon\n
uses! There are four parts, now after all. Oops,\n
did I spoil that?|

Anyway, have some gold, and good luck!|

poison Ciraxis?|

afterwards, but we couldn't get a response\n
over his bloodcurdling screams.|\n

on the garden. \e[5|2]The Chief of our Air Force,\n

\s[5]
Okay,\w[5] so,\w[5] we have a few\n
ways to tackle this.|

\s[1]
We can just go down and rush,\w[5]\n
removing as many foes as we\n
need to in the process.|

\s[5]
And the alternatives?|

\s[2]
There are cracked walls about,\w[5]\n
so perhaps we may use those\n
to speed things up?|

\s[1]
I dunno,\w[5] though,\w[5] seems dangerous.\w[10]\n
I caught a glimpse of a armored man\n
who we may have trouble with.|

\s[5]
An armored man you say?\w[15] I wonder\n
how Ciraxis would fare against them.|\n
Sounds like that's a solid idea if we're\n
well-prepared.\w[10] Heck,\w[5] could be the key\n
to getting out fast.|\n
Is there anything else of note?|

\s[1]
There is a room full of chests\n
to the north-west.|

\s[2]
Some enemies seem to have\n
chest keys on them.|

\s[5]
I see...\w[15] I should check and see\n
if we have the Enragement Ring\n
still,\w[5] or if a thief is with us.|\n
It's certainly a bother to have to\n
deal with foes for mere chest keys\n
like that.|

\s[2]
We need to secure this stairway\n
to the north.\w[10] I sense that Marc is\n
in that direction.|

\s[5]
I'd say at least three people are\n
neccessary to completely secure\n
the route upstairs.|\n
Alright,\w[5] let's get to it,\w[5] then!|

Several things here:|\n
1.\w[10] We can simply go down and work\n
our way through the enemy.|\scroll
2.\w[10] Possibly make use of cracked walls\n
to progress quicker.|\scroll
3.\w[10] Be wary of some armored individual\n
by one of the cracked walls.|\scroll
3.\w[10] Lots of chests at the top left.\w[10]\n
Enemies have chest keys.|\scroll

But,\w[5] most importantly,\w[5] we need at least\n
three people to secure the stairway!|

status page,\e[5|0] but it's convenient\n
to just check your unit stats.|\n

gain one primary and two secondary\n
stats dependent on the mag.|\n

they depend on the user's personal\n
preferences.|
