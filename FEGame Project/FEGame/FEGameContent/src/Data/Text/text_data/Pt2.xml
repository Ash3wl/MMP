      <Value>\f[5|Char]\g[UndergroundHall]\s[5]Alright, so here's how the hair mags work:
First, you pick one out from the convoy.
Then you use it. The end.|\s[-2]\wait[20]\s[5]\e[5|1]Oh, I guess I missed a few details.\wait[5]\e[5|0]
When you use a magazine, all your
stats go up by 5.|
These decrease by one per turn,
and when they hit zero, the mag's
effect expires.|
\e[5|1]You could also check the third
status page,\e[5|0] but it's convenient
to just check your unit stats.|
In ADDITION to those bonuses, you
gain one primary and two secondary
stats dependent on the mag.|
These bonuses are pretty huge, but
they depend on the user's personal
preferences.|\scrollFor example, I'm a flaming dyke.\wait[10]
One of those mags was yuri?|
I'll probably get more out of that
than most people, but the mag with
the dudes?\wait[10]\e[5|2] No thanks.|\e[5|0]
You can only get one magazine's
effects on a unit at a time. Use a
new one to forget the old stuff.|
Anyway, try playing around with 'em,
you'll figure more out by doing.\wait[10]

      <Value>\f[5|Char]\g[UndergroundHall]\s[5]Mag info, quick version! Use a mag to
gain stats across the board that fade
over time. +5 to be exact.|
In addition, gain three stats. Which stats
depends on the mag, and how much of
each stat depends on the user's tastes.|
10 uses per mag, and they last 5 turns...

from me.|\s[5]Are you serious?|\scrollWhat are the odds of

      <Value>\f[2|Ash]\f[5|RS]\s[2]Alright,\w[5] R.\w[10]S.\w[10] I'm back\e[5|2].|\s[5]Oh,\w[5] hello,\w[5] Sir.|\scrollI took the liberty of waiting
more than our appointed time.|\s[2]What?\w[15] Well,\w[5] whatever.\w[10]
Let's try this again.|\s[5]Roger,\w[5] Sir.\w[10]
What's your order?|\s[2]It's not an order but...|
Well,\w[5] let's try something else.\w[10]
I'll talk to you and you'll answer\e[5|2],
alright?|\s[5]As you command,\w[5] Sir.|\s[2]Yeah,\w[5] about that...\w[15]
Try to sound more...\w[15]
natural,\w[5] please.|\e[5|0]\s[5]Affirmat--\wait[15]\scrollErr...\w[20]\e[5|3]alright.|\s[2]Great.\w[10] Now,\w[5] let me see...\w[15]
Oh,\w[5] I know.|
You have a daughter,\w[5] don't
you?\w[15] So,\w[5] how's she been
doing?|\s[5]A daughter?\w[15] \e[5|0]Ah,\w[5] yes,\w[5] Myrmi.\w[10]
Her proficiency with the blade is keen.|
But her dexterity and understanding of
the blade has still not matched that of
a truly praiseworthy swordmaster.|
Yet,\w[5] her appearance and understanding
of a sword is admirable,\w[5] and fitting of
a daughter of a leader such as me.|\s[2]...|\e[5|3]\s[5]Err...\w[15]I mean...|\scroll\e[5|0]She's "way cool"\e[2|2] and
uh...\w[15]\e[5|2]nice looking.|\s[2]Uh...\w[15] is that really...\w[15]
Um,\w[5] it...\wait[20]\e[2|0]that's better...?|\scroll\e[2|0]Now...\w[20] What do you do in
your free time?|\e[5|3]\s[5]Free time?\w[15] \e[5|0]You wound me,\w[5] Sir.|
I would never slack of--\wait[15]\scroll...\wait[20]\e[5|2]\m[5|5]Err,\w[5] I mean\wait[20]...\w[15] I enjoy playing
\e[2|3] card games.|\s[2]Hey,\w[5] that's nice.\w[10]
Isn't so hard,\w[5] is it?|\s[5]Sir,\w[5] I\w[20]...\w[20]\e[5|2]\m[5|5]err,\w[5] Ash,\w[5] I\w[20]...\w[10]
If I were to propose my opinio\w[20]...\w[15]
\m[5|5]Err,\w[5] I mean,\w[5] to be honest,\w[5] I...|\scroll...|\scroll\e[5|0]Yes.\w[10] \e[5|3]Yes,\w[5] it is,\w[5] Sir.|\s[2]\e[2|0]Hmm...\w[15] Well,\w[5] R.\w[10]S,\w[5] That was
pretty alright,\w[5] I'd say.|
Should really do it again
sometime.|\s[-2]\m[5|4]\w[2]\s[-2]\s[4]Please do not--\wait[15]\s[2]Alright,\w[5] I'll see you later.|\s[-2]\m[2|0]\w[2]\s[-2]\s[4]\e[4|3]Sir,\w[5] I...|\scroll...|</Value>

      <Value>\f[5|Matthew]\e[5|2]\f[2|Vandal]\e[2|2]\s[5]...|\s[2]Huh? Matthew, you alright\e[5|0]?|\s[5]Oh, I am. \e[5|2]It's just, fighting with
another team feels a bit weird.|\s[2]I can imagine. \e[2|0]These guys aren't
exactly the most normal\e[5|0].|\s[5]Well, neither is our team.|
But these guys seem like they're on a
whole different level\e[2|2]. \e[5|1]Their skill is
something else.|\s[2]I can agree with you on that.
Though they all seem to have
fought themselves\e[5|0] before.|\s[5]Ah, so forced teamwork...|\scroll\e[5|2]Not exactly a fan\e[2|0], but if it gets us both
alive in the end, I guess I don't mind.|\s[2]Not everything\e[5|0] can be solved with
the power of friendship, you know.|\s[5]Hey, I'm aware of that!|
You know what I mean. \e[5|1]A team should
be willing to fight for others as much
as they fight for themselves.|\s[2]How honorable of you.|
\e[2|2]Either way, strength comes in bunches.
Can't really judge\e[5|0] them when they get
the job done.|\s[5]I suppose.|\scrollI just hope we pull our weight over here.
Would be bad if we made any enemies\e[2|0]
out of these guys.|\s[2]I don't think that's something to be
worried about. They seem to all be
together when shit hits the fan.|\s[5]What a strange relationship that
must be.|
\e[5|1]But then again, strangeness
comes in bunches as well.|\s[2]And that's our specialty,
isn't it?|\s[5]You bet it is.|</Value>
