No more MarkyJoe rejects?|\s[1]Probably. \e[5|0]It doesn't get much
more final boss-y than that.|\s[-2]\f[2|nil]\f[2|Ash]\s[2]I'm glad that loose plot point was
settled at last, now the ghost of
Title Here can finally rest in peace.|\s[3]That wasn't too bad.
\e[3|1]Anyone else hungry though?|\s[6]It was a long day, and now while we're
plot relevant. I have to say I'm glad
we saw it through to the end.|\s[4]I am, too. Now if you all excuse me,
I have a delivery to make.|\s[-2]\f[3|nil]\wait[2]\f[3|Wolfram]\wait[2]\s[3]Who were you delivering it
to, again?|\scrollIs the fresh bread not cold
by this point?|\s[4]Of course it's not, I've been at this
for years. I know all the tricks.|\s[-2]\f[4|nil]\wait[15]\s[5]Seems GrimaJoe dropped what was
left of the bread, what should we
do with it?|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\f[1|Ciraxis]\s[1]Clearly there is nobody more deserving
of it than me, so I'll just...|
Wait, where did---\wait[15]\s[-2]\wait[10]\f[1|nil]\f[2|nil]\f[3|nil]\f[4|nil]\f[5|nil]\f[6|nil]\name[-3|Char]\g[Charbread1]\wait[30]\s[-3]...Is this sourdough?|\s[-2]\wait[15]\g[Charbread2]\wait[30]\s[-3]Oh, what were you all talking about?|\s[-2]\g[Black]\wait[5]\g[UndergroundHall]\f[2|Ciraxis]\f[5|Ash]\s[2]...Today was trash.
C'mon Ash, we're leaving.|\s[5]Uhh, yeah okay, but before that.
What about that oven over
there?|\scrollIt made that ultimate bread or
whatever, right?|\s[2]Take it with us, we deserve something
for all this nonsense Marc dragged
us into.|\s[5]Alright.|\s[-2]\f[2|nil]\f[5|nil]\g[Black]\wait[5]\g[UndergroundHall]\f[1|Char]\f[3|Wolfram]\f[5|Marc]\f[6|Avraxas]\s[5]With that taken care of...
What a morning. Sheesh.|\s[3]\e[3|4]I'm about ready to collapse...|\s[-2]\f[2|Purt]\wait[2]\s[6]That was quick.
How did it go?|\s[2]\e[3|0]Actually, I'm still delivering it.|\s[5]Huh?|\s[2]One of the Marcvirate we just
defeated ordered a few loaves
from me.|\s[5]Are you serious?|\scrollWhat are the odds of
that happening?|\s[2]Well, since I'm already here.
You want to pay for it, Marc?|
We could have a picnic, or
something like that.|\s[5]Eh. \e[5|1]Why not.|\scrollA picnic sounds great
right about now.|\s[-2]\f[1|nil]\f[2|nil]\f[3|nil]\f[5|nil]\f[6|nil]\g[Black]\wait[5]\g[Picnic]\wait[40]\name[-3|Ghost]\s[-3]And so, they had a picnic and everything
was resolved, blah blah blah.|\event</Value>

      <Value>\f[5|Marc]\e[5|2]\g[UndergroundHall]\s[5]Alright,\w[5] there are those Sigil things.\w[10]
\e[5|3]I think I remember seeing them in
Awakening or something?|
Pretty sure they spawn more enemies.|
But I'm hardly worried there...\w[15]\e[5|2] Those
guys surrounding GrimaJoe look strong.\w[10]
I should make sure we're all prepared|
There's not much else to say about this.\w[10]
We just need to take down GrimaJoe!|</Value>

      <Value>\music[silence]\wait[50]\music[donut]\g[Black]\wait[50]\name[-3|Ghost]\s[-3]With Marc failing to defeat GrimaJoe, he
was mocked, as expected... but then...
something truly horrific occured.|\scrollGrimaJoe took Marc and ate him alive as
his friends watched on, utterly powerless.|\scroll...And that is where his story ends.|\scrollTo the public, Marc's disappearance is
shrouded in mystery.|\scrollSince that day, his comrads who went along
on this quest act as if they know nothing
of what occured. How strange.|\scrollOne guess is GrimaJoe took them as his
personal slaves and brainwashed them.|\scrollPerhaps the even was so scarring it
became repressed in their memories?|\scrollNobody will likely ever truly know what
happened on that fateful night.|\scroll\g[GOCG3]Afterwards, GrimaJoe took over Marc's
everything. Heck, he even changed the
name of all related social media.|
Much to the initial confusion of fans.|\scrollGrimaJoe proved surprisingly popular with
just about everyone, and he surpassed all
others on the website in subscribers.|\scrollHe became the most beloved Youtuber to
nearly 330 Million fans for the rest of the
site's lifespan.\scrollMarc's existance soon faded into obscurity
and he was subsequently forgetten.
GrimaJoe taking his place in their minds.|\s[-2]\wait[100]\event</Value>
