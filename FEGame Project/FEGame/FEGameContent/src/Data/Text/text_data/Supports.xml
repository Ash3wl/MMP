me,\w[4] my lord?|\s[5]\x[100]Yeah,\w[5] you.\w[17] How are
you holding up?|\s[2]\x[97]Oh,\w[4] I...\w[9] I believe that I am
doing Pherae proud,\w[5] sire.|
I must say,\w[6] however,\w[6] it is strange
to see these battles unfold before
me so unlike they would on paper.|
There are some factors my studies
did not account for,\w[6] it seems,\w[6] and
so I must alter my drills...|\s[5]\x[100]Is that what you're
doing there?|\s[2]\x[97]Yes,\w[6] my lord.\w[18] These brief respites
are precious,\w[5] and I cannot waste
them if I am to stay in peak condition.|\s[5]\x[100]That's great,\w[6] kid.|\s[2]\x[97]...Respectfully,\w[6] sire,\w[6] I am at
least a full year your senior.|\s[5]\x[100]Huh.\w[15] No kidding?|\s[2]\x[97]I am not a man known
for jests,\w[5] my lord.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]Yeah,\w[6] I'm beginning
to get that.|\s[2]\x[97]If I may,\w[6] my lord,\w[6] there
is another thing...\w[21]
My name,\w[5] sire,\w[5] it's--|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[100]Oh,\w[4] there she is.\w[11]
Excuse me. |\s[-2]\wait[12]\m[5|1]\wait[3]\f[1|nil]\wait[12]\s[2]\x[97]It's Sir Marcus.\w[16]\b[2|1] My
name is Sir Marcus.|</Value>

you doing,\w[5] there?|\s[-2]\wait[6]\r[2]\wait[8]\s[2]\x[97]Some minor saddle repairs,\w[6] my lord.|
My father always said that a knight
is the sum of many parts,\w[6] and each
must be strong for him to be whole.|\s[5]\x[100]Wise words.\w[16] You might not be
much fun to be around,\w[6] but
we're lucky to have you.|\e[2|2]\s[2]\x[97]I...\w[9]\e[2|0] Th-thank you, \w[6] sire.|\s[5]\x[100]Uther.|\s[2]\x[97]Pardon?|\s[5]\x[100]I remembered your name,\w[6] didn't I?\w[17]
The least you could do is grant
me the same courtesy.|\s[2]\x[97]My apologies,\w[6] Lord Uther.|\s[5]\x[100]No,\w[6] not like that.\w[16]
Just Uther.\w[18] Say it.|\s[2]\x[97]...Of course,\w[6] Uther.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]There,\w[6] you see?\w[14] The heavens didn't
come crashing down around you.|
Now we're just two battle-brothers,\w[5]
nothing separating us but distance.\w[10]
We actually have much in common!|
We can grouse about our sword
instructors,\w[6] or the servants stealing
things,\w[6] or how our codpieces chafe.|\s[2]\x[97]I-Indeed.\w[16] I am happy to serve
in whatever capacity you need
of me,\w[6] my l-\w[20] Uther.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[100]I can see we have
a ways to go yet...|</Value>

a common greeting when you've

many more of them if we don't
focus on the battle.|\s[-2]\r[4]\m[2|3]\wait[4]\r[3]\wait[12]\s[3]\x[100]Well,\w[6] you know how it is.
I'm often so busy with strategy
meetings and inventory checks
and the like,| the only time I can
see my friends is out on the field.|\s[4]\x[97]Imagine how it must be

You were close by him through it all,\w[5]

chance,\w[5] you should speak
to Lord Elbert of this.|
Hearing his thoughts on the
matter might clear your head.|\s[3]\x[100]Yeah,\w[6] maybe.\w[20] But how could
I say these things to him?|
"I want to be a child for a while
longer,\w[6] can you wait for me?"|\s[4]\x[97]Uther.|\s[3]\x[100]Hm?|\e[4|1]\s[4]\x[97]You know him better than I,\w[6]

a common greeting when you've

where that came from.|\s[2]\x[100]Glad to hear it.\w[18]\e[2|0] So,\w[5] do you
have a moment?\w[14] I wanted
to talk to you about Elbert.|\s[5]\x[97]Of course.\w[18] As you know,\w[6] I will
be serving as one of Lord Elbert's
retainers in the coming years.|\s[2]\x[100]Right.\w[14] So you have known
him for some time already,\w[5] yes?|\s[5]\x[97]Indeed.\w[14] He is a kind man,\w[6] and I am
glad to have known him.\w[16] My heart is
always full when I am in his presence.|\s[2]\x[100]Ha,\w[6] alright then.\w[18] So,\w[7] what was it

You must have noticed a change.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[97]I...\w[12] I would be lying if I said

this is about,\w[6] I think.|\s[2]\x[100]Is it that obvious?|\s[5]\x[97]You are Duke Ulric's son and
the next Lord Regent of Lycia.|
It is always on your mind,\w[7] and
so,\w[7] always on your face.|\s[2]\x[100]...I'm starting to miss the Marcus

the middle of something?|\s[2]\x[148]Oh,\w[5] Lord Uther!\w[18] Nothing of import;\w[9]\e[2|1] and
yet,\w[6] it is hard to conceive of anything I
would rather do than speak with you.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]You disarm me,\w[7] my silken princess.|
I had come with the intent of flattering
you into submission,\w[7] and instead you
have me blushing like a virgin maid.|\s[2]\x[148]Somehow I sense this
weakness is feigned.|\s[5]\x[100]Heh,\w[5] perhaps.\w[12] Come then,\w[3] let us
find each others' true vulnerabilities.|\s[2]\x[148]I would rather we keep
telling each other sweet lies.|\s[-2]\wait[4]\m[5|4]\wait[6]\s[4]\x[100]Shall I compare you to a
shining saint from on high?|\s[2]\x[148]And what does that make you,\w[4]

world,\w[5] come to steal me away?|\s[4]\x[100]I'm not sure I appreciate
that likeness.\w[6] Perhaps
something more imposing?|\s[2]\x[148]You do have something of
the dickens about you.|
Yes,\w[6] I think you would make
for a fine djinn,\w[6] or...\w[21]
Perhaps an incubus?|\e[4|0]\s[4]\x[100]To be perfectly honest,\w[6] I've
lost track of this conversation.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]Oh,\w[5] I apologize.\w[16] The incubus is a
handsome,\w[6] seductive fiend,| said to
steal his way into women's beds and
plant the seed of evil inside them.|\e[4|1]\s[4]\x[100]I'm afraid playing into such
a role would destroy what
tattered honor I have left...|\e[2|1]\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]I won't tell if you don't~|\e[4|0]\s[4]\x[100]Hold a moment.\w[14] You've completely
diverted me from my course,\w[5] here...|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]I have no idea what you are
talking about,\w[6] my lord.|
In any case,\w[6] I must return to my
rituals if I would be of any use.|\e[4|1]\m[4|4]\s[4]\x[100]You're doing it again!\w[14] Do not

walls once more,\w[6] duckling,\w[6] and this
time I won't be so easily deterred.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]My gates are unbarred
and unguarded,\w[4] as ever.\w[18]
Yet,\w[4] do you dare enter?|\s[2]\x[100]I would weather any storm
for the love of such a woman.|\s[5]\x[148]Be careful with that word,\w[6] my prince.|
Kingdoms rise and fall on the whims
of besotted fools who believe that
they are in love.|\s[2]\x[100]Besotted,\w[6] am I?\w[16] I grant that I may
be a fool,\w[5] but I assure you,\w[5] my
feelings transcend the physical.|
Aye,\w[5] I would even raise
or level a kingdom for you.|\s[-2]\wait[4]\m[5|4]\wait[8]\s[4]\x[148]Then let us see the proof
of your conviction,\w[6] Uther.|
Show me something tangible,\w[6]
instead of more honeyed words.|\s[-2]\wait[4]\m[2|3]\wait[8]\s[3]\x[100]I warn you,\w[6] princess,\w[6] my heart
burns wicked hot.\w[15] You might
soon regret the touching of it.|\m[4|4]\s[4]\x[148]Ha!\w[11] All men say the same,\w[6] but in truth
they are like phosphorus.\w[15] They burn
bright and loud and fizzle out quickly.|\e[3|0]\s[3]\x[100]You speak as if from experience.\w[18]
Just how many men have you
seen fizzle out,\w[6] exactly?|\b[4|1]\s[4]\x[148]Is this your proof,\w[4] then?\w[16] More boasts,\w[5]
and a fear of seeming inadequate
next to my previous conquests?|\s[3]\x[100]I fear no such thing.\w[18]\e[3|1] I am merely

      <Value>\f[2|Leonard]\f[5|Uther]\s[2]\x[120]Uther.\w[16] I have some...\w[9] concerns\w[9]
about the way you run things.|\s[5]\x[100]Color me surprised.\w[14]
What's the problem?|\s[2]\x[120]Some small security issues,\w[6]
nothing to make a fuss over.|
But when you become regent,\w[6]
any such weaknesses will
affect the nation as a whole.|\s[5]\x[100]Spare the lecture,\w[6] Leonard.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[120]I do sound like a mother hen
whenever I deal with you,\w[6] don't I?\w[20]
\e[2|0]Firstly,\w[6] your base of operations.|
You tend to choose enclosed
positions with a single entrance,\w[7]
to withstand an armed assault.|\s[5]\x[100]And what's the
problem with that?|\s[2]\x[120]To begin with,\w[6] locking yourself in a box
leaves you trapped.\w[14] If an enemy elects
not to storm your gates,\w[5] so to speak,|
you will be forced to either starve to death
or abandon it.\w[16] You need an escape route.|
Such positions also offer little visibility.\w[15] You
need windows,\w[5] or a watchtower,\w[5] some way
to keep an eye on all directions of approach.|
Windows also help in the case of a
gas or smoke attack,\w[5] which would be
fatal in one of your preferred dens.|\s[5]\x[100]I'm with you so far.\w[16] What else?|\s[2]\x[120]Your documents and letters should be
encrypted.\w[16] Even a basic cipher will do.|
Spies do not steal your papers,\w[6] or you
would know they have been intercepted.|
They just read them,\w[6] and then put
them back where they came from.|
Most spies,\w[6] however,\w[6] can barely read
in the first place,\w[6] and could not crack
a code if their life depended on it.|\s[5]\x[100]Fine.\w[16] What else?|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[120]This next subject is a little...\w[9]\b[2|0] sensitive.\w[12]
You'll want to grit your teeth,\w[6] honey.|\s[5]\x[100]Just get on with it.|\s[2]\x[120]You're too familiar with your subordinates,\w[6]
Uther.\w[18] We don't know half of these people.|
Just because you paid them handsomely,\w[6]
it doesn't mean they're not taking a second
purse from an enemy agent.|
Some of them even have direct ties to the
enemy,\w[6] and yet you invite them into your
quarters and speak candidly with them.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]Do you really think me so daft?\w[16] You've
been harassing me with these lessons
for as long as we've known each other.|
I know how to feed an enemy just enough
truth to get them listening,\w[6] and how to
stuff their ears with lies afterward.|\s[2]\x[120]This is different,\w[5] Uther.\w[18]\e[5|0] We're dealing
with professionals,\w[5] now,\w[5] people who
can tell when they are being played.|
They will swallow your lies with placid
smiles,\w[6] and at the same time take note
of everything you do not say.|
It is good that you know the game,\w[5] but
as we move forward,\w[5] it would be better
if you let me handle such things.|\s[5]\x[100]Hn.\w[18] Perhaps.|
\e[5|1]But then,\w[6] why should I trust you?\w[21]
How am I to know that you have not
been playing me from the day we met?|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[120]You can't,\w[6] and realizing that
means there's hope for you yet.|</Value>

expect more lessons in
intrigue and politics,\w[5] today?|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[120]Well,\w[6] I was going to address that
mop you call a hairdo,\w[8] but I suppose
this would be more constructive.|\m[5|5]\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]Ha!\w[12] You,\w[6] of all people,\w[7]
criticizing my hair?|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[120]Watch yourself,\w[6] love,\w[6] or one of these
nights you might not wake up again.|\s[5]\x[100]Turnabout is fair play,\w[6] Leonard.|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[120]Ah,\w[6] and what a fine note to begin on,\w[6]
for such are the rules of blackmail.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[100]Eh?|\s[2]\x[120]Any noble of sufficient power is going
to be invited to this dance at some point,\w[7]
Uther,\w[7] so it's best we prepare you for it.|
Even the likes of Elbert will face such
scandals before his day is done.|\e[5|2]\s[5]\x[100]I'll happily own up to my reputation,\w[7]
but don't you dare try to tell me that
Elbert has a dark secret of some kind.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[120]That's the point,\w[6] Uther,\w[6] you don't need one.\w[16]
If someone wants to blackmail you,\w[5] half
of the time they'll just make something up.|
Even if it's an outrageous lie,\w[6] people will keep
talking about it,\w[6] and soon it will be only thing
anyone thinks of when they hear your name.|
\e[5|0]The answer is not to be unassailable,\w[6]
because that's impossible.\w[15] Rather,\w[6] you
need to be ready with a counter-attack.|\s[5]\x[100]You mean blackmail them back?|\s[2]\x[120]Precisely.\w[15] It's a concept known as
"mutually assured destruction".\w[18] If you
take me down,\w[6] I take you down too.|
The problem then becomes finding
out who is doing it,\w[7] and what their
motive is,\w[7] and so on.|
You must weigh the cost of their
attack against what you can do.\w[16]
It gets complicated very quickly.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]I'm getting a headache
just hearing about it...|\s[2]\x[120]The most important thing is that
you remain aware and agile,\w[6] just
like on any other battlefield.|

anyway?\w[14] You said yourself that I
should leave it to the experts.|\s[2]\x[120]I can't make these decisions for
you,\w[6] Uther,\w[6] I can only advise you
and carry out your orders.|
And what if I'm busy elsewhere,\w[6] or
if I'm taken out?\w[16] You will need to
fend for yourself at some point.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]Yeah,\w[5] I guess.|\s[2]\x[120]Besides,\w[6] the same principles you use
in dealing with these local politics will
apply on the grand stage.|
Threats of invasion,\w[6] false alliances,\w[6]
propaganda campaigns...\w[11] These are the
same motions made on a larger scale.|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[100]I suppose that makes sense.\w[18]
Tactics and strategy,\w[6] right?|\s[2]\x[120]Precisely.\w[16] Which brings
me to today's lesson...|\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[100]Oh,\w[6] gods...|\s[2]\x[120]The importance of scheming while in power.|
\b[5|0]Just like you need to run weapon drills and
practice the melee in tourneys,\w[6] you need
to keep your political skills sharp as well.|
You can consider the local infighting and
backstabbing that is part of our proud
Lycian heritage a sort of training ground.|\s[5]\x[100]You make light of it,\w[6] but lives are
lost in those squabbles.\w[16] I would
rather not be part of that.|\s[2]\x[120]Be that as it may,\w[7] they are going
to happen with or without you.|
And if you win them,\w[6] you can keep
the bloodshed to a minimum.|
Besides,\w[6] if you do abstain from such
things,\w[7] you will be unprepared when
Bern or Etruria move against you.|
How many lives will be lost then,\w[7] hm?|\s[5]\x[100]...I cannot deny
the truth of that.|\s[2]\x[120]And they will move against you if they see
that you cannot control the Marquesses.|
Your father knows this well.\w[18] He has spent
the better part of twenty years asserting
himself over them in this matter,\w[6] or that.|
It is not about the individual victories,\w[6] but
about appearing strong to his adversaries.|\s[5]\x[100]Okay,\w[6] Leonard.\w[12] I get it.\w[15] So what sort
of schemes are we talking about here?\w[18]
Should I be blackmailing and kidnapping?|\s[2]\x[120]Nothing so vulgar as that.\w[19] But you must control
who gets placed in office,\w[6] which lords are at
odds and which are allies,\w[6] how the public feels|
about various policies...\w[24]
Sometimes you will have to set yourself up as
the villain so that one of your pawns can be the|
hero,\w[6] and sometimes you will have to sacrifice
them so that you can be beloved again.|
\e[2|3]\b[2|1]It is a dangerous game,\w[6] and one you
will be playing for the remainder of your
short and terrifying life.|\e[5|3]\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]And people wonder why I hate
the idea of being regent.|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[120]Trust me,\w[5] Uther.\w[18] I don't.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[100]...Thanks.|</Value>

The freedom of a commoner,\w[7] with
the power of a highborn lady...\w[13]
It is an enviable thing,\w[6] I should think.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]Such is the way the fates do their

Aye,\w[4] I have freedom and comfort
both,\w[6] but I am alone with them

And in a way,\w[5] both have costs...|\scrollTo be free is to know you could
do anything in the world,\w[7] and to
second-guess your every choice...|
"Would I have been happier
as a rancher?\w[14] Could I have
helped more people as a cleric?"|\scroll\b[2|1]And to be wealthy,\w[6] when so many
others are starving in the cold...
\b[2|2]It is no easy thing to ignore.|
\b[2|1]Yet,\w[5] my ancestors built this house
for me;\w[10] would they be displeased if
I shared their riches with strangers?|

fought so hard to provide me?|\s[5]\x[97]...|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[152]I'm sorry.\w[16] I suppose I've been

spent long years as knight-errants

proximity...\w[11]\b[5|0] to certain...|\s[2]\x[85]Ah.\w[16] The shadow of the
Dragon is vast and deep.|\s[5]\x[97]Indeed.\w[18] The very day my father finished
his apprenticeship,\w[6] he took to the nearby|
ranges and destroyed not one,\w[6] but four
different bandit clans,\w[6] root and stem.|
He returned after sundown with the heads
of each chief,\w[6] and was named a whole
knight and Paragon of the March immediately.|
\b[5|1]He was not an errant for even a full day.|\s[2]\x[85]Sir Isaac was an exceptional--|\s[5]\x[97]His companion,\w[6] Sir Meredith the Strong,\w[6]
was made knight-errant on a day of calm.|
Unable to prove herself through combat,\w[6]
she instead used her magic to divert
a river that was causing flash-floods.|
This new course ran across a barren field
and brought it to yield crops again.|
It took her three days,\w[6] and so that
was the duration of her errantry.|\s[2]\x[85]...|\s[5]\x[97]Even Sir Deacon was awarded his crest in
a single week,\w[6] for such was how long it
took him to write his eulogy for Lord Roy -|
\b[5|0]and he has never picked up a sword!|
Yet Lady Matilda awarded him the largest
estate of all three,\w[6] which the good Lord
Elbert has since honored.|\s[2]\x[85]Shall we now compare you to Sir Lucien
the Star Knight,\w[6] who earned his crest by
restoring the deposed Ostian dynasty?|
Or Sir Eugene the Mountain King,\w[6] who
leveled a mountain for Roland's Way?|\s[5]\x[97]No,\w[6] sir.\w[16] I understand that these
are acts of legend,\w[6] never again
to be repeated,\w[6] but...|

performed any heroic deeds of note.|

of a stomach for the kill,\w[6] but racing through|
the woods with the dogs barking and the
horns blaring was always a thrill.|
It was a good way to see the countryside,\w[6]
besides,\w[6] and gave me opportunity to pick
flowers to decorate my lord's bedchamber.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[97]How thoughtful of you.\w[19]\b[2|0] What of husbandry?|
My father was very keen on breeding,\w[6] for
he felt a knight should raise his own steed
as he should forge his own sword.|
But I understand that many noblemen
consider such things beneath them,\w[6] and
leave them to the artisans.|\s[5]\x[101]Aye,\w[6] that was the way of it with
Lord Grayson.\w[19] He was not a man
who liked to dirty his hands.|
Except when it came to butchering
his game.\w[17]\b[5|1] He seemed to take
pleasure in that...|\s[2]\x[97]...|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[101]Perhaps that is telling of the

myself that I might be useful later...|
That is most satisfying to me.\w[18]
When I am still,\w[6] forced to occupy

so well as this,\w[7] though.|\s[2]\x[152]What do you mean?|\s[5]\x[115]I don't really want
to get into it.|\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[152]Too bad!\w[20] You can't say a

...Hello.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]Hi.|\scroll\e[2|0]Are you ready
to give in?|\s[5]\x[112]Why are you so worked up over this?\w[17]
You're not giving me any choice.|\s[2]\x[152]It's for the good of the team,\w[5] Harken.\w[18]
If you can't trust us with this,\w[5] then
how can you trust us in battle?|
Besides,\w[4] it clearly weighs heavily
on you.\w[16] It will do you some good
to share your burden.|\s[5]\x[112]Alright...|\s[-2]\wait[35]\s[5]\x[112]I first arrived in Lycia by way of Sacae,\w[7]
and that meant stopping in Araphen.|
Lord Alaric was feuding with the state
at the time,\w[9] so he was making generous
promises to any who would join his army.|
The incumbent Marquess,\w[6] Dastan,\w[6] was
making no such promises,\w[6] so I joined
Alaric -\w[9] he was the rightful heir,\w[5] anyway.|\scrollI spent a while running letters,\w[6] then some
time in a spearwall,\w[6] and then enough older
boys died that I was captain of my squad.|\s[2]\x[152]How horrid...|\b[5|1]\e[5|3]\s[5]\x[112]That was only the beginning.|\scroll\b[5|0]Lord Alaric was starting to win,\w[6] so he insisted
on making sure we carried our momentum.|
He started pushing us into more and more
desperate fights,\w[6] all the while planning his
next few moves in advance...|
Moves that he needed his knights and his
archers for,\w[6] so to minimize casualties among
them he threw us infantry to the wolves.|
The first of these moves left only three
kids in my squad,\w[6] so we were joined to
another.\w[18] After that...\w[25]\b[5|1] there was just me.|\e[2|3]\s[2]\x[152]Oh,\w[7] Harken...|</Value>

your squad was killed?|\s[5]\x[112]A general called Sir Winchester took me on
as his squire,\w[5] and that was even worse.|
I was forced to stand by and listen while he
made his battle plans,\w[5] while he sentenced
dozens more kids to their deaths.|
\b[5|2]I was furious.\w[5] When the battle started,\w[6]
he would sit in safety and watched the militia
trudge toward their doom,\w[8] I...|\e[2|3]\s[2]\x[152]...|\b[5|0]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[112]Then I couldn't take it any more.|
I took his sword right from his hip.\w[14]
He barely even noticed.\w[16] What did
he need his sword for,\w[5] back here?|
I knocked him from his horse.\w[14]
I stood over him.\w[11] I cursed him.\w[21]
Then I starting hacking away.|\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[152]No!|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[112]In the end,\w[6] I only bruised him a little
and put some dents in his armor.|
They dragged me away,\w[6] but before
they could lock me up,\w[6] I escaped
and ran for my life.|
\b[5|0]I arrived in Pherae not long after.|\s[2]\x[152]\e[2|0]...And jumped straight
into another fight.|\s[5]\x[112]Just like a Westerner,\w[6] right?
I guess some stereotypes are true.|\s[2]\x[152]No...\w[12] \e[2|1]Just like a knight.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[112]...|</Value>

There's a mill,\w[5] a smithy,\w[5] and a school that used
to be a courthouse.| There was to be a church,

I never made it far as a cleric.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]Sorry,\w[5] ma'am.\w[16]\b[2|0] I've been reflecting
on my decision to become a knight,\w[5]
and on what that really means.|
\b[2|1]More than that,\w[5] I've been thinking
about the vows I must take...|\b[5|0]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]Ah.\w[19] Yes,\w[5] the oath is quite dire
in its wording,\w[5] is it not?|
\b[5|1]"I so swear to forego the pleasures
of my mortal life,\w[5] and live only as a
vessel to the spirit of the Saint..."|\b[2|0]\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[152]I-indeed.|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]You're not the first one to be
daunted by those words,\w[5] lass.\w[18]
That's the purpose of them.|
There are a hundred thousand little boys
out there growing up with dreams of
slaying dragons and saving princesses -|
of riding back to their dirt-poor village in
their shining armor and smiling smugly
down at those who picked on them.|
It's an easy thing to become a page,\w[5]
after all,\w[5] and there's always work for a
decent squire...| But when it comes time
to say the words,\w[5] to give up everything
for the sake of ideals and servitude...|
\e[5|1]Well,\w[6] that's when we find out who is just
a dreamer and who has the real steel.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]...|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]Try not to dwell on it.\w[14] It will only distract
you from your training.\w[18] When the time
comes,\w[5] you'll know what your answer is.|
And until then,\w[5] you're picking up skills that
will be useful in a dozen different fields.|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[152]I hadn't thought of it that way...\w[19]

don't mind me asking...|\s[5]\x[130]What is it,\w[5] child?|\s[2]\x[152]Do you often think about what you
gave up when you became a knight?\w[18]
Or do you ever wish to go back it?|\b[5|1]\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[130]You don't know my story,\w[5]
do you,\w[5] Lady Isadora?|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]N-no,\w[5] ma'am,\w[5] sorry.|\b[2|0]\b[5|0]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]I had something of an unfair advantage
over many other knights.\w[16] I did not have
a mortal life to give up,\w[5] you see.|\scrollI was betrothed to wed the Marquess of
Araphen,\w[5] but he first insisted a diviner do
a reading on my womb to gauge my fertility.|
Not one,\w[5] but three different seers gave me
the same result:\w[12] I would never bear a child.|
For the sake of diplomacy,\w[5] my father sent
me to the local monastery,\w[5] where I spent
a long time grieving...\w[19]\e[5|1] Until I found escape...|\s[2]\x[152]You would become a knight!|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]It was a long,\w[4] hard road,\w[6] but I fought my
way into the temple guard,\w[5] and from there,\w[5]
distinguished myself through acts of valor.|
Before long,\w[5] my father had no choice but to
officially recognize my worth:\w[12] the church,\w[5] the
commons,\w[5] even other lords were demanding it.|\scrollIn the end,\w[5] I had to work much harder
than your average knight,\w[6] but I had no
life to give up.\w[16] This was my only path.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[152]An inspirational tale,\w[5] ma'am.|\e[5|1]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[130]A little girl is locked away by her father
because she can never bear children,|
and claws her way out to become a bitter,\w[5]
hardened brute,\w[7] oath-bound to serve him.|\scroll\b[5|0]It doesn't seem all that romantic to me.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[152]I...|\scroll\e[2|2]No,\w[5] I choose not to see it that way.\w[22]
You could have given up,\w[5] ma'am.|
You could have resigned yourself to
the cloister,\w[5] and a life of prayer and
charity.| Many women choose that life
willingly;\w[9] it must have some value.|\s[5]\x[130]Hmm...|\s[2]\x[152]But you wanted control of your destiny.\w[19]
So you took it in your own two hands,\w[5]
and changed it into something else.|
\e[2|0]As far as I'm concerned,\w[5] that is the
most admirable thing I can think of.|\s[5]\x[130]Ha!\w[12] Perhaps you're right,\w[6]

Tell me,\w[5] then,\w[5] what is it you
would be giving up?|\e[2|3]\s[2]\x[152]...Everything.\w[18] I have the world
at my fingertips right now,\w[5] but...|
\e[2|0]Of all the things I could be,\w[5] the only

question for you today.|\s[2]\x[130]Oh?|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[152]What sort of things do I have
to look forward to as a knight?|
Obviously,\w[7] there is much to be
said of the pride one feels for
fulfilling their sacred duty,\w[5] but...|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[130]Aye,\w[6] there are petty pleasures to be had,\w[4]
as well.\w[19]\b[2|0] Among my favorites is how
everyone in your road will make way.|
You can be riding up the highway or
walking down an aisle -| when folk see
you coming,\w[5] they drop all their squabbles
and work as one to clear a path.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]Heh.|\s[2]\x[130]There are many such little things that
come from the prestige of knighthood.|
Others will let you speak your mind,\w[5]
without you needing to raise your voice.|
Strangers will rush to help you dismount
and give up their beds for you.\w[18] Balding
priests will give their blessings,\w[5] blushing|
maids will offer tokens of luck,\w[5] restless
guards will ride escort to the border...|\scroll\b[2|2]At times you are so rich in goodwill and
praise that it begins to feel like a burden.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[152]Truly?|\e[2|0]\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[130]No,\w[5] I speak only in hyperbole.\w[16]
\e[2|1]But it gets very close sometimes.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]I see.\w[17] You make it sound
very glamorous.|\s[2]\x[130]It can be.\w[15] But I think the best
pleasures are the quiet ones...|\scroll\b[2|1]When you arrive at your estate,\w[6]
the sun setting,| and you can
barely make out the coat of arms
on the banners over your door...|
But you know it's there,\w[6] and it's
yours,\w[6] and you swell with pride.|\scrollThe stable is empty,\w[6] as the staff
don't yet know you're back,\w[6] and you|
have the chance to stable your
own horse without a dozen
grooms fighting to impress you...|
\b[2|0]And you make a mess of it
because it's been so long
since you did it for yourself...|\scroll\b[2|1]You ease yourself into the bath,\w[5]
and feel the ache of a long
campaign slowly fade to memory...|
\b[2|2]And for a little while,\w[6] forget that
you are even a knight at all...|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]How lovely...|\scroll\b[5|0]\b[2|0]I hope I become just like you,\w[5] Dame
Abelia.\w[18] So fierce and strong on the
surface,\w[5] but serene and kind beneath.|\s[2]\x[130]I think you are already the knight
you wish to be,\w[5] Isadora.\w[18] Your friends
all seem to think so,\w[5] at any rate.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[152]You are too kind.|\s[2]\x[130]Enough of this.\w[18] Another of a knight's great
pleasures is to crush their foe before them
like tinder,| and we cannot do that if we
stand around all day sharing our feelings.|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[152]Aye,\w[5] ma'am!|</Value>

book,\w[6] my lady?|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[150]I did,\w[6] actually.\w[12] It was of poor quality,\w[5] with
large,\w[5] ugly drawings clearly intended
for children,\w[5] but I loved it all the same.|
\e[5|0]In fact,\w[4] it reminded me of one such book
I had as a child,\w[4] which got me thinking...|
You knew my father and my uncle in
their youth,\w[5] did you not?\w[14] What were
they like,\w[4] back then?|\s[2]\x[85]Well...\w[14] I was but a child when Lord
Hausen and Master Lundgren could
last have been called "young",\w[5] but...|
Forgive me for saying,\w[5] my lady,\w[5] but
your father was much like yourself.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[150]...In what way?|\s[2]\x[85]He was very...\w[10]\b[2|1] Hm...|
\b[2|0]Tactless...?|\scroll\b[5|0]Frankly,\w[5] my lady,\w[5] he was very much
concerned with his own comforts
over matters of politics and formality.|
He would say whatever he wished,\w[5]
shirk his duties to go hunting,\w[5] even
threaten those who impeded his fun.|
Of course,\w[6] he was well-loved by the
townspeople,\w[6] for he was often among
them throwing feasts and parties.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[150]Ha!\w[11] The very things he chides me for.\w[15]
I am not ashamed to say I am delighted
to learn of his hypocrisy.\w[14] Tell me more!|\s[2]\x[85]Even as young men,\w[6] your father
and his brother were often at odds.|
Master Lundgren was studious,\w[5] and
responsible,\w[5] and always insisted that
he should be made the heir instead.|
Yet,\w[5] at the same time,\w[5] he was quite
jealous of your father's adventures,\w[5]
and would sometimes try to mimic him.|
He would only injure himself,\w[6] or offend
someone with one of his attempted jokes,\w[6]
and never really enjoyed himself anyway.|
\e[5|0]So,\w[6] jealousy rooted deeper and deeper...|\s[5]\x[150]...|\s[2]\x[85]They loved each other,\w[6] however,\w[6] and
Lord Hausen would eventually begin to
make efforts to include him where he could...|
But by that time,\w[6] he was preparing for his
coronation,\w[6] and had no time for such follies,\w[6]
so Master Lundgren never truly forgave him.|\s[5]\x[150]How sad...\w[11] I shall have to give my
uncle a great hug upon my return.\w[18]
Perhaps I could make him something...|\s[2]\x[85]A fine sentiment,\w[6] my lady.|\s[5]\x[150]What were you like
in your youth,\w[6] sir?|\e[2|2]\s[2]\x[85]I should say it
hasn't yet ended.|\e[5|1]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[150]If you say so.|</Value>

You say it did not matter to the farmers
you were raised with,\w[6] but...|
Surely,\w[7] the townsfolk,\w[5] or perhaps the other
children,\w[5] would have given you trouble?|\s[5]\x[130]Oh,\w[5] fer sure.\w[14] Whenever they wanted
a reason t' criticise my behavior,\w[5] that
was th' thing they'd always jump to.|
"That lass is the seed of evil,"\w[6] they'd say.\w[12]
"She's born of an unholy union!"|
But if I weren't,\w[6] they'd just find some other
reason I was misbehavin' and blame that.|
Little Merry was left-handed,\w[5] so that's why
she always acted up.\w[16] Petey the Shepard
liked other boys,\w[5] so that was his flaw.|

of our campaign.\w[15] It has been an
arduous one,\w[6] I must admit...|\s[3]\x[83]And through it you comported yourself
admirably,\w[6] sir.\w[14] It is no mean feat you
have accomplished,| shielding the
realm from the hordes of the enemy
with naught but children and guile.|
I have come to understand that,\w[7] now.|\s[5]\x[85]...|\b[3|1]\s[3]\x[83]Perhaps...\w[15]\b[3|0] You are,\w[5] indeed,\w[5] the better
man for the job of Knight-Commander.|
I have always treated our order like I did
the army before it,\w[7] and my knighthood as
little more than a prestigious rank I could|
throw around to get my way.\w[17] I often acted
little better than a brute,\w[6] in truth...|\s[-2]\wait[8]\r[5]\wait[16]\s[3]\x[83]When we are done here,\w[6] and return to

you.\w[16] Humility.\w[10] Decorum.\w[10] Temperance...|\s[3]\x[83]Aye,\w[6] sir.|\s[5]\x[85]So,\w[5] perhaps...\w[16]\e[5|1] You can strive to find
some middle ground,\w[5] between your
natural manner and your code.|\s[3]\x[83]Sir?|\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[85]There are certain advantages to your
way of doing things,\w[6] it seems.\w[18] I have
been approached by a number of our|
allies,\w[6] who have all expressed concern
that you have lost your edge recently.|
Since you were...\w[10] chastened,\w[6] as it were.|\e[3|1]\s[3]\x[83]Is that so?|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[85]And I must admit,\w[7] although you are at
times offensive,\w[7] you have never brought
shame to our lord.\w[18] Perhaps I acted rashly.|\s[3]\x[83]Enough double-edged compliments,\w[6]
Eagler.\w[16] Say the words already.|\s[5]\x[85]Very well.|\e[5|0]\scroll\b[5|2]Sir Wallace,\w[9] in recognition of your
distinguished service and exceptional
valor on the battlefield,\w[5] I,\w[5] Sir Eagler,|
in the name of Lord Hausen of Caelin,\w[5]
do affirm you as a true knight of worth.|
As your patron,\w[5] I pledge to vouch
for your honor and defend it
against any who would inveigh.|\m[3|3]\s[3]\x[83]You didn't have to say them all!\w[21]
I feel like I should have rounded
up some witnesses for you.|\e[5|1]\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[85]...After all this,\w[6] you still have
no respect for the code.|\e[3|0]\s[3]\x[83]I respect it plenty.\w[18] I just think it impractical
to perform a full ceremony at a time like this,\w[7]
with such stakes.\w[21]\e[3|1] Thank you,\w[6] all the same.|\s[5]\x[85]You are very welcome.\w[20] Now,\w[6] then.\w[14]

me being a better fit for the badge...?|\e[3|0]\s[3]\x[83]Hey,\w[5] that's taken out of context!\w[18]
You can't go spreading that around

I've seen you leap your horse from
clifftops,\w[7] weave beautiful baskets,\w[7]
recount your adventures at the fire...|
But you seldom seem to enjoy any of it.|\s[5]\x[105]That's cruel of you

Your brow didn't so much

tell me of your passions.|\s[5]\x[105]Hmm...\w[16] I do like to ride,\w[6] but it is
difficult to enjoy when my friends
are in danger.|
When I am scouting for the enemy,\w[7]
or riding in battle,\w[6] I am full of tension
and fear.| When I am on open fields,\w[9]
making a good pace with nothing on
my mind...\w[16]\e[5|1] That is a different thing.|\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[150]Yes,\w[6] yes!\w[15] I am the very same way!|
When Walnut gives it his all,\w[6] and
my heart gets to pounding,\w[6] I feel
ever so alive!|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[105]The weaving,\w[6] too,\w[6] is pleasing to me.\w[18]
Yet it is not the doing that is satisfying,\w[6]
but the making of something.|
When I am done,\w[6] my fingers aching
and all the stubborn knots smoothed
out,\w[6] it is then that I feel joy.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[150]Oh,\w[5] I see.\w[14] It is like cooking,\w[6] then.|
\e[2|2]When I am mixing and pouring,\w[6]
I will become cross and shout
at my utensils,| and when it is on
the stove,\w[6] I will pace and fret...|
\e[2|1]But when it is on the platter,\w[6] and
I have the flowers arranged just so,\w[8]
why,\w[5]\m[2|2] nothing makes me happier!|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[105]I am fond of cooking,\w[6] as well.\w[15]
When I was young,\w[6] my mother taught
me to collect herbs for medicine,\w[6] and|
she showed me which ones were good
for this dish or that one.\w[15] I have tried
to stay in practice ever since.|\s[2]\x[150]You will have to teach me
some of your recipes!|\s[5]\x[105]I would like that.\w[16] There is a sort of

Caelin will have the world's foremost military

pieces with each exhaled breath.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[150]That's a sad way to look at things.|
If we do,\w[3] indeed,\w[3] die with each day,\w[6]
then I choose to believe we are also
born with each waking.|
Then we get to live a million lives!|\e[5|3]\s[5]\x[80]What are a million lives but a million
ways to suffer heartbreak and tragedy?|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[150]A million ways to laugh,\w[6]
and love,\w[6] and learn!|
\b[2|2]Try as you like,\w[5] creature,\w[5] you
simply cannot spoil my mood.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[80]That is for the best.\w[16] I can only truly
appreciate my misery when I can
compare it to your tyrannical hope.|\e[2|0]\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[150]...|\scrollYou are a spiteful thing,\w[6] are you not?\w[16]
I wonder,\w[4] what made you so broken?|\s[5]\x[80]Who says I am broken?\w[16]\x[130] This is the natural
state of all things,\w[6] and you will mature into
what I am when time heals your wounds.|\s[2]\x[150]Hmmmm.\w[14] No,\w[5] I don't believe that at all.\w[14]
\e[2|1]\b[2|2]For the fact that I exist as I am is proof
enough that this is how I was meant to be.|
If I were supposed to be any other way,\w[6]
I would be that way,\w[5] instead of how I am.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[80]As I said.\w[15] You are a
tyrant of optimism.|\s[2]\x[150]Shush.\w[15] I am going to boost your self-
esteem through song,\w[6] and you will
stand there and behave yourself.|\e[2|1]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[80]...|</Value>

The moss is too slippery,\w[6] and all you will
gain for your efforts is a bruised bottom.|
But he was certain that if he got himself
a good running start,\w[6] he could scramble
to the top with his momentum alone.|\s[5]\x[80]May your teeth fall out and
your tongue turn to worms.|\s[2]\x[150]\b[2|0]Don't interrupt.|\scroll\b[2|2]So I stood back and watched him pace
out fifty feet,\w[5] and I told him again that he
was letting his pride get the better of him.|
He said that I would soon be eating my
words,\w[5] and began to run.\w[14] No sooner had
he put his first foot on the wall did he slip.|
All his momentum did for him was dash his
face against the wall,\w[6] and sure enough his
nose went straight out the back of his head.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[80]...\w[9]What?|\s[-2]\wait[4]\r[5]\wait[9]\s[5]\x[80]You lie.|\s[2]\x[150]\b[2|0]I am offended you would say such a thing.|
It punched right through his skull and flew
across the yard,\w[6] and a crow plucked it out
of the air and carried it off.|\e[5|2]\s[5]\x[80]That is the most ridiculous...\wait[20]
\e[5|0]\x[130]Actually,\w[5] I will choose to
believe that.\w[16] It is too funny.|\e[2|1]\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[150]That's the spirit!\w[15] You should have heard him
cry like a child,\w[5] clutching at his mangled face.|
\e[2|0]\b[2|2]He fell to his knees and repented for not
believing me,\w[5] for saying that I was foolish.|
I touched him once with my staff,\w[5] and mended
him,\w[5] and he kissed my feet in thanks.\w[14] He
swore to build a castle in my honor...|\s[-2]\wait[4]\r[5]\wait[9]\s[5]\x[80]And you have lost
me once more.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[150]I don't care,\w[6] I'm not doing this
for you.\w[16] I just want an audience.|
\b[2|0]\e[2|0]What are you complaining about,\w[6] anyway?\w[14]
You said you wanted to be miserable.|\b[5|1]\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[130]...I did not know the true

Well,\w[5] you've found me.\w[18]
What do you want?|\s[5]\x[105]...|\s[2]\x[144]What,\w[6] the report?\w[16] Nothing's changed.|
We're a long way from home.\w[15] There's
a thousand Etrurians at each compass

soon we will all be dead.\w[21] Satisfied?|\s[5]\x[105]I don't believe that is true...\w[17] But that

to anything else you have to say.|
I'd rather just cover my ears and die
in blissful ignorance of your betrayal.|\s[5]\x[105]We're not going to die,\w[5] Cybil.\w[16]
We need to talk about this.|\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[144]I don't care,\w[6] alright?!\w[19] Just go.|
Go start your new life in your silver
collar as her decorative savage
boy and leave me out of it.|\s[5]\x[105]If I don't have your blessing,\w[5] then
I can't do it.\w[20] I'll stay with you,\w[5] and
we'll keep working.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[144]You think I want you following
me around,\w[5] gazing off into the
distance and sighing constantly?|
To spend every day with the
constant guilt of knowing I
robbed you of a happy life?!|
\m[2|2]I'm done!\w[15] I don't want anything to do

You'd pick one of us,\w[5] you know?|
That's why she started wearing those
oversized shirts,\w[5] growing her hair out...|
\b[5|0]Remember how she used to look?\w[12]
Like a grubby,\w[5] half-starved boy?|\b[5|0]\s[2]\x[105]I never knew.|\s[5]\x[144]Of course you didn't.\w[16] You always
had your eyes on the horizon,\w[5] never
on what was going on beside you.|\s[2]\x[105]Now that I think about it...\w[22]\e[2|1] You never
used to wear skirts,\w[5] did you?\w[15] You said
they were frivolous,\w[5] and stupid...|\e[5|2]\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[144]I-I don't know what

None of it matters now,\w[5] I suppose.\w[19]
You chose the princess,\w[4] and that's
just the way it is.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[105]I didn't "choose" her...|
I fell in love.|\s[5]\x[144]If you say so.\w[21]\b[5|2]\e[5|1] Fine.|
You have my blessing.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[105]Thank you,\w[5] Cybil.|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[144]I'm going to keep wearing

      <Value>\f[2|Eiry]\f[5|Magnus]\s[2]\x[148]We would seem to have a moment to
ourselves...\w[18] Now would be a good time
to continue your lessons,\w[5] then.|\s[5]\x[95]Whatever you say,\w[6] boss.|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[148]Now,\w[6] then.\w[18] So far,\w[6] I have been teaching you
to cast from rote,\w[5] which is a fine thing if you
want stable,\w[5] well-formed spells.| The standard
incantations have been perfected over the
course of centuries,| and using them allows
you to harness the expertise and knowledge
of all the wizards who came before you.|
However,\w[5] firing off someone else's fireballs
like a glorified onager will get you only so far.|
To ascend to the next level,\w[5] you must come
to understand what the words themselves
mean,\w[5] and how to structure a spell.|
\b[2|0]Can you think of any situations where it
would benefit you to know such things?|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[95]I suppose...\w[12]\b[5|0] If I wanted to modify a spell,\w[5]
to make it behave differently?\w[19] Say,\w[5] to
make a blade of wind blow hot or cold...|
Or to make a fireball tight and focused,\w[5]
in order to reduce collateral damage.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]...\w[4]Those are the exact examples used
in a remedial spellcraft class.\w[16] Have you
been doing extracurricular research?|\s[5]\x[95]No,\w[5] boss,\w[5] it just...\w[11]
makes sense.|\s[2]\x[148]Hmmm...\wait[21]\b[2|2] Well,\w[5] I would applaud you
for doing so,\w[5] if such were the case.|
As your teacher,\w[6] I do want to stay
informed of your progress,| but that
does not mean I am unwilling to let
you seek lessons of others.|\s[5]\x[95]I--|\e[2|2]\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]Unless it were the likes of that dullard
Professor White,\w[6] whose witless ramblings
would only harm what I have done.|\s[5]\x[95]...|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]But as you said,\w[6] you naturally
came to that conclusion of
your own reasoning.|\s[5]\x[95]...Indeed.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[148]Very well.|\scroll\b[2|2]Yes,\w[6] those are ways in which an understanding
of spellcraft can be applied.| However,\w[7] getting
the syntax of the language correct and ensuring
the spell's overall arrangement of elements is|
cohesive is of utmost importance,\w[9] for otherwise
the casting of it could have disastrous results.|
It is theoretically possible to write a new spell
from whole cloth with a complete understanding
of the language,| but to acquire such knowledge
one would need to live for centuries...|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[95](...Was it Professor White,\w[6] or...\w[12]
...Blake?\w[15] ...Heights?\w[15] He did
seem something of a dullard...)|\e[2|2]\s[2]\x[148]Which is why it is so important that
a student of such advanced age
work that much harder to master it.|
\m[2|2]\b[2|0]Tell me,\w[6] Magnus,\w[6] what is the
cardinal element of magic?|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[95]Uhh...\wait[32]\e[5|3]
I don't know,\w[6] mistress.|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[148]So perhaps it might be wise
of you to pay attention.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[95]Yes,\w[5] mistress.|</Value>

    <Item>
      <Key>P1EiryMagnus_B</Key>
      <Value>\f[2|Magnus]\f[5|Eiry]\s[2]\x[95]So...\w[19] You're saying that all
magic is based on life-force?|\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]No,\w[7] Magnus.\w[19] That is a gross oversimplification
of the concept.\w[16]\b[5|0] It is clear now that you have
been poisoned by the meddling of lesser minds.|\b[2|1]\s[2]\x[95](Damn you,\w[6] Professor White...)|\s[5]\x[148]There is a power,\w[6]\b[2|0] called by some "energy"
and by some "mana" that permeates every
physical thing in this world.\w[21] Yes,\w[4] it is true|
that living creatures are possessed of it,\w[7]
but so too are the minerals in the earth
and the light that pours down from the sky.|
It is what gives an object its weight,\w[6] what
binds it together,\w[6] what allows it to be
transformed from one thing to another.|
When you cast a spell,\w[6] you are giving a
sequence of commands to the energy of
the things around you.| You can use it to
change the shape of a thing,\w[6] or move it,\w[6]
or transfer its energy to another object.|
Today,\w[7] I want you to forego the use of
incantations and try to manipulate this
energy by feel and force of will.|\s[2]\x[95]What,\w[6] just...\w[11] wish for
a fireball to appear?|\e[5|2]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]...\w[9]You are being facetious,\w[7] but yes,\w[7]
that is essentially what I am asking of you.|
\b[5|0]Recall times in the past that you have
summoned one using an incantation,\w[6]
and try to feel those same sensations.|\s[2]\x[95]Hmm...|\s[-2]\b[2|2]\e[5|0]\wait[50]\s[2]\x[95]I think...\w[12] I can feel it,\w[7] boss.\w[19] It's like...|\scrollA prickling heat in my bones...|
static under my skin...|
fluttering wings in my stomach...|\scrollBut I am feeling these things at once
within my body and outside of it,\w[6] as if...\w[17]
my body were the world itself...|\s[5]\x[148]...Truly?\w[19]\b[5|1]
So quickly...?|\s[2]\x[95]I've...\w[11]\b[5|0] I've always been aware of
it when I cast before,\w[8] anyway...|
\b[2|1]I sort of just...\w[9] mumbled the lines
without thinking about them,| and
focused my attention on the surge
of heat and the sudden release...|\s[5]\x[148]Interesting...\w[21] A surly,\w[5] level-headed
pragmatist like yourself...\w[14] I had thought
reason would be the best path for you.|
\e[5|1]But it seems,\w[6] underneath,\w[6] you
are quite the emotional fellow.|\b[2|0]\s[2]\x[95]Phew.\w[11] I'm exhausted.\w[16]
And no fireballs,\w[6] it seems.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]Of course not.\w[17] Casting without a tome
is impossible,\w[6] or at least,\w[6] it has been
since the so-called "Ending Winter".|
The purpose of this exercise was to
heighten your awareness of the ambient
energy around you.\w[16] Such is the fuel that|
powers your Anima magic,\w[5] and being able
to find rich sources of it and sense when
your enemy is manipulating it will be vital.|\s[2]\x[95]I get it.\w[18] And when I am bending the
elements,\w[6] I will be able to feel the flow
of energy and correct malformations,|
instead of needing to pay such close
heed to my arcane grammar.|\e[5|1]\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]Precisely.\w[19] Very good,\w[5] Magnus.|
You are mastering this with remarkable
ease -\w[10] and it is certain you could not
have heard THAT from Professor White.|\s[2]\x[95]What have you got
against him,\w[6] anyway?|\e[5|0]\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]He has no comprehension of the
craft and no appreciation for genius.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[95]He flunked you,\w[6] didn't he?|\e[5|2]\m[5|5]\s[5]\x[148]And he was humiliated when the wider
magical community read my manifesto
and came to a consensus on its merit.|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[95]But he never apologized,\w[6] huh?|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]I will have my revenge.|</Value>

you said it was impossible to cast
spells without using a tome?|\s[2]\x[148]To change the world from one way to
another,\w[6] rewriting the rules of life itself...|
That is no simple matter,\w[6] and takes a
great amount of power to even attempt.|
So,\w[6] spell tomes are written on rare and
ancient parchment,\w[6] using magical ink
made of spirit dust and silver ore.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[95]You told me.\w[16] The mana of these materials
is consumed,\w[6] beginning a chain reaction
that carries words and gives them power.|\s[2]\x[148]Correct.\w[16] But a counterspell is just telling
the world to snap back to its natural form.|
With so much mana already in motion,\w[6] it
is a simple thing to neutralize a spell and
return things to a state of calm.|\s[5]\x[95]If it's so simple,\w[6] how does anyone
ever succeed in casting at all?|\s[2]\x[148]There are many ways.\w[19] Words of power.\w[15]
Glyphs,\w[6] wards,\w[6] and sigils.\w[15] Animal sacrifice.|
It is said that the elder druids of Sacae merge
their will with that of the cosmos,\w[6] so that the
natural state of things is whatever they wish.|
\b[2|2]\e[2|1]I find that speaking swiftly enough to
finish your incantation before they can
their counterspell works adequately.|\scroll\b[2|0]\e[2|0]In the end,\w[6] this is why I taught you to know
both the logic and the heart of spellcasting.|
Your enemies will have more than one way
to cast,\w[6] and you must judge how to respond.\w[17]
You will be learning for the rest of your life.|\s[5]\x[95]And I'm plenty grateful.\w[19]\e[5|1] But time
spent thanking you is time I could
be practicing these counterspells.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[148]Try this one.\w[18]

Leonard,\w[6] I assure you.|
I merely thought a man of your

desire of my company.|\s[2]\x[120]There is no reason we cannot
converse as colleagues,\w[6] yes?|
You are,\w[6] of course,\w[6] on Lord

resolved in a peaceable and
punctual manner.|
Whether that is Lord Uther's
goal remains to be seen...|\s[2]\x[120]Are you implying my lord would attempt
to gain something from this bloodshed?|
In the manner of,\w[6] for instance,\w[6] your Sorceror-
General's power coup of eight years ago?|\s[5]\x[148]Indeed.\w[12] Much like his father Duke Ulric's
violent seizure of the March of Araphen
from its ruling house some twelve years ago.|
\b[5|1]Or perhaps,\w[6] more recently,\w[6] like his very

about your earlier claim,\w[6] mistress.|
I was on my home turf,\w[6] I had vetted
and tested all of my informants,\w[6] I had
been using an expensive disguise...|
By all rights,\w[7] I should have had the
better of you in that situation.|
\e[2|1]And then I remembered...\w[21]
The magic bureau has access
to means which I do not.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]Indeed.\w[16] The use of scrying and
precognition opens up vast new
dimensions for intelligence agents.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[120]Precognition?\w[18] Truly?|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]Well...\w[21] It is very expensive,\w[6] and its
accuracy is questionable,\w[6] but yes.|
Visions of the future are sought by a small
division of our agents,\w[7] both through direct
means and by seeking others who have them.|\s[2]\x[120]I imagine you turn up a lot
of raving drunks,\w[6] that way.|\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]You would be right.\w[19]\e[5|0] But every now and then,\w[7]
some milk-maid has a true psychic vision,\w[7]
and hearing it has allowed us to save lives.|\s[2]\x[120]Fascinating.\w[18] I heard the Western tribes'
so-called "Council of Seers" deployed such
magics,\w[6] but had dismissed it as myth.|\s[5]\x[148]Mm.\w[12] We were of the same
mind...\w[18] Until recently,\w[6] that is.|\s[-2]\wait[4]\m[2|3]\wait[8]\s[3]\x[120]Do tell...|\s[-2]\wait[4]\m[5|6]\wait[8]\e[6|1]\s[6]\x[148]Ah,\w[4] but what sort of rival would I
be then?\w[16] I must keep some small

If what you're saying is true,\w[6] then
this has world-changing implications.|
The Council of Seers don't concern
themselves with the weather or with
people's love lives...|
They claim to watch over the course
of human history itself,\w[6] the rise and
fall of entire generations.|\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]I don't see how that changes things
one whit.\w[16] This is an Etrurian secret,\w[6]
one I am not authorized to divulge.|\m[2|2]\s[2]\x[120]But you've already...\w[19] Blast it.|
How about this,\w[6] then.\w[15] I will make
guesses as to its nature,\w[6] and you
can tell me when I'm wrong.|
You don't even have
to confirm anything.|\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]...|\s[2]\x[120]So,\w[6] we've established that the Council has
foreseen something,\w[6] and that your government
has reason to believe they are correct about it.|
Which means that your own psychics have
corroborated their findings...|\b[5|2]\s[5]\x[148]I said no such thing.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[120]...Or that you have found some
physical proof of their claims.|\e[5|1]\b[5|1]\s[5]\x[148]...|\s[2]\x[120]Okay.\w[18]\e[2|0] So I would then assume
it has something to do with
Solomon's bogeyman in Bern.|\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]Well...|\s[2]\x[120]...But not directly?\w[16]
Hm.\w[11] Interesting.|\b[5|0]\s[5]\x[148]...|\s[2]\x[120]So...\w[12] That would mean...\w[30]
\b[2|1]Hmm.\w[20] Perhaps,\w[6] then...|\s[-2]\wait[6]\r[5]\wait[12]\s[2]\x[120]...Could it be that...\w[16] the threat in Bern,\w[4]
whether real or not...\w[9] is a misdirection?|
And some outside influence,\w[4] whatever that
may be,\w[4] wants us squabbling amongst
ourselves while it moves unseen...?|
And then,\w[6] that would mean...\w[19]\b[2|0] There is
a very real threat to our world,\w[6] and our
continued infighting will bring it about.|\s[5]\x[148]Remarkable...|\s[2]\x[120]What proof did your
people find,\w[6] then?|\s[5]\x[148]Our scryers have seen an agent
at work,\w[6] of unknown origin.|
They are elusive,\w[6] and clever,\w[6] and
their appearance is ever-changing.|
They are well-versed in the oldest
of magics,\w[6] the kind not seen since
the dawn of time...|\s[2]\x[120]If ever there was a reason

What do you want,\w[6] Leonard?|\s[2]\x[120]How about a smile,\w[6]

When we're on duty,\w[6] we must treat each

There is no life and death

them judging me over it.|
It's all well and good for you to go
peacocking about and calling people
"darling".\w[16] You're an independent agent.|
If I were to do it,\w[6] my commander might
decide to give away my deployments

I can be a uniquely devoted friend.|\s[5]\x[110]Let me tell you what I want of you.|\scroll\b[5|1]Your desperation bleeds out of you,\w[7]

inevitability of this,\w[7] your demise.|
As they close in on you,\w[5] you see the
skeins of their plot stretching back
into your past,| and all the times you
foolishly stepped right into their hands.|
You see that it was by your own action
that you lost your lover,\w[6] your title,\w[6] and
your master.| The fullness of despair
overcomes you,\w[5] and your heart drums
out the last of its pitiful song.|
The darkness comes,\w[5] and it is a mercy.|\s[2]...Fine.\w[21] I will face my doom.\w[19]
Now that I have seen it,\w[5] it
holds little power over me.|\b[5|0]\e[5|1]\s[5]\x[110]And now that you have given me something

what it was you were saying.|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[92]Oh?|\s[5]\x[130]It was bringing up your parents that

a resident potter at the castle,\w[5] and
indeed,\w[5] Eustace was his name.|\s[-2]\wait[4]\r[2]\wait[8]\s[5]\x[130]Aye,\w[5] and his wife was a painter.|
He would craft fine urns and vases,\w[5] and
she would decorate them,\w[5] and together
they were much beloved by my mother.|
She often invited the potter's wife to
her garden parties,\w[5] who would always
bring her son...| A gangly boy with a shrill
voice who fought with all his might to
be the center of attention,| but never
had anything to say when he won it.|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[92]Not the most flattering depiction,\w[5]
but aye,\w[5] that was me.|\s[5]\x[130]You had lighter hair back then,\w[5]
almost blonde.\w[18] And your nose
didn't quite fit your face...|\s[2]\x[92]It took me some time
to grow into it.|\s[5]\x[130]All this time,\w[5] we were childhood
friends...\w[12] And you knew?|\e[2|0]\s[2]\x[92]I thought you did,\w[5] too!\w[18] I kept making
jokes about Crooked Pete,\w[5] the guard
with the peg leg,| and how the castle dog
chewed on it when he slept at his post.|
You would just give me a queer look,\w[5]
then continue working,\w[5] so I thought you
were just being your usual broody self.|\m[5|5]\s[5]\x[130]Oh,\w[5] gods!\w[16] I thought you had
been talking to my mother,\w[5] in
an effort to woo me!|
So when you wrote the song
about that night the castle
was taken over by rats...|\e[2|1]\s[2]\x[92]That was a personal account,\w[5] yes.|
Believe me,\w[5] as bad as it was up in
the lord's chambers,\w[7] it was a hundred
times worse down in the cellars.|
That couplet about how I dropped
my sock and watched it drift down
the hallway,\w[5] as though in a stream...|\b[5|1]\e[5|2]\s[5]\x[130]Oh,\w[5] ew.|\b[2|2]\s[2]\x[92]Hahaha!|\b[5|0]\e[5|0]\s[5]\x[130]This is so strange...\w[12] We were friends for

drills on sacred days.|\e[2|1]\s[2]Oh,\w[5] how lovely!\w[19] I wish that we had such
orders here in Elibe.\w[16] Those of us who
study the pugilist arts are few here.|\s[5]You need no such orders.\w[19]
You merely need dedication,\w[6]
and attunement with your body.|\e[2|0]\s[2]Yes,\w[6] I know.\w[17] But it is demoralizing to
be so alone in my craft.| If I had a
gathering,\w[6] or even just a partner,\w[6] I
would have so much more confidence...|\s[5]Why don't I be your partner?\w[19] I don't
know very much about the forms,\w[6] but
I'm very dedicated.|\e[2|1]\m[2|2]\s[2]Oh,\w[6] yes, yes, a
thousand times, yes!|
Together we will make
each other unstoppable!|\e[5|1]\s[5]I don't know about that,\w[6] but I will be
glad to have someone to bond with.|</Value>

      <Value>\r[2]\f[2|Elle]\f[5|William]\s[2]I'm telling you,\w[6] I don't
want to hear it!\w[17] The
doctrine is very clear!|\s[5]Is it,\w[6] though?\w[19] The sect of Calrad
disputes whether Deus or Thor is the
true leader of the gods.| The followers
of Destin believe the Saints themselves
became gods,\w[6] and many missionaries to|
Sacae come to believe that the spirits
are gods.\w[19] And if the spirits are gods,|
and we become spirits when we die,\w[7] does
that make us all sleeping gods?|\wait[2]\s[nil]\r[2]\e[2|2]\s[2]Enough!\w[19] We are followers of Elimine,\w[5]
and Elimine's teachings are very clear!|\s[5]Ah,\w[5] but are they?\w[19]
The sect of Andromeda--|\s[2]No!\w[19] I don't want to hear about any
more of your blasted fringe cults!!!|
The sect of Andromeda was wiped
out because their blasphemies could
not be borne!|\scrollThere are nine gods,\w[6] one of whom
must never be named,\w[6] and once a
generation they choose a mortal to|
be their champion among the living.|
All your talk of them being facets of
a single,\w[6] greater god are nothing but
raving madness!|\wait[2]\s[nil]\wait[8]\f[2|nil]\wait[26]\s[5]Is this how the atheists feel when
no one will hear their evidence?|
Hm.|</Value>
