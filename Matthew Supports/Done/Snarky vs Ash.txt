Another fool who wishes to fight me?|

\f[6|Ash]
\s[6]
Oh, it's you.|\n
You're that SnarkyJoe guy, right?|

\s[1]
\f[1|Snarky]SnarkyFoe.|\n
\f[1|SnarkyHappy]Memorize it, as it will be the name of your slayer!|

\s[6]
\f[6|AshHappy]Sure, great.|\n
\f[6|Ash]I've heard that you can duplicate, like me.|\n
\f[6|AshHappy]I'd like to ask you some questions about that.|

\s[1]
\f[1|Snarky]And why would I disclose my power to you?|

\s[6]
\f[6|Ash]Uh...I guess you don't have any reason to...|\n
\f[6|AshHappy]I would certainly appreciate it, though.|

\s[1]
Very funny.|\n
\f[1|SnarkyHappy]Even if I were to tell you...|\n
You wouldn't live to make any use of it!|

\s[6]
\f[6|Ash]So you won't tell...|\n
Well, maybe I can still salvage something...|\n
\f[6|AshHappy]You know, after dealing with you.|

\s[1]
ZAHAHAHAHAHAHA!|\n
We'll see about that!|
