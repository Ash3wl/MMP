Hello, Ephraim.|

\f[5|EphraimHappy]
\s[5]
Oh hey, what's up?|

\f[2|MarcSad]
\s[2]
Besides this whole fetch quest thing...\n
\f[2|Marc]I'm doing alright.|\n
\f[2|MarcHappy]I appreciate the help of an old buddy.|

\f[5|Ephraim]
\s[5]
It's fine.|\n
It wouldn't have been nice of me to refuse, haha.|

\f[2|MarcSad]
\s[2]
That's also at least one more person who\n
hasn't tried to kill me, here helping me.|

\f[5|EphraimSad]
\s[5]
I wonder how many of those exist at this point.|

\f[2|Marc]
\s[2]
Now that you mention it...|\n
\f[2|MarcSad]A LOT of people have tried to kill me by now, huh?|\n
Evil clones, magic chinchillas...|\n
I wish they would tone it down a notch.|

\f[5|Ephraim]
\s[5]
I think it's pretty obvious, why there's a lot of them.|\n
\f[5|EphraimHappy]Every hero needs a villain, if I were to guess.|

\f[2|MarcThink]
\s[2]
I guess?|\n
\f[2|Marc]I'm getting bored of being the hero all the time.|\n
It's getting so overdone by this point.\n
\f[2|MarcSad]I'm not even that heroic of a character.|

\f[5|EphraimSad]
\s[5]
So you'd rather be an enemy?|\n
\f[5|Ephraim]Hasn't that been done before, though?|
\f[2|Marc]
\s[2]
Yeah I know, but like...|\n
\f[2|MarcHappy]I feel like I can be an awesome fucking villain.\n
I'd just need some good fucking motivation and shit.|

\s[5]
I wonder about that.|\n
\f[5|EphraimSad]Though from a technical standpoint, I-

\s[2]
Yeah like, I feel like I can be have this really cool gray morality.\n
You know, make the player question his ideals and shit?|\n
Then you can have this sick battle where Reisen and I wo-

\f[5|Ephraim]
\s[5]
I know what you're getting at.|\n
I mean.\w[20].\w[20].\w[20]\f[5|EphraimHappy]I would say it can be good.|

\f[2|Marc]
\s[2]
I dunno.|\n
\f[2|MarcSad]I wouldn't say it's relatively easy, but you know, like,\n
\f[2|MarcHappy]I always advise people to think outside the box and shit.|

\f[5|EphraimSad]
\s[5]
I mean sure, that's all good and all, but...\n
It doesn't solve the issue.|

\f[2|MarcThink]
\s[2]
Huh?|

\f[5|Ephraim]
\s[5]
Didn't you just say you wanted people\n
to "tone it down" with killing you?|\n

\f[2|Marc]
\s[2]
I did.|

\f[5|EphraimSad]
\s[5]
If you're the enemy, that only makes it worse.|

\s[2]
...\n
\f[2|MarcSad]Fuck.|\n
I guess I'm always prone to dying no matter what.|\n
\f[2|Marc]Can't I get a break for a change?|\n
\f[2|MarcSad]...|

\f[5|Ephraim]
\s[5]
Don't look at me like that.\n
\f[5|EphraimSad]You were the one who named it Ragefest.|\n
\f[5|EphraimHappy]I just did what you asked for.|

\s[2]
Alright.|\n
\f[2|Marc]Guess I'll just go die then.|

\f[2|nil]

\f[5|EphraimHappy]
\s[5]
Ah Marc...|\n
\f[5|EphraimSad]What is this contest doing to you?|
