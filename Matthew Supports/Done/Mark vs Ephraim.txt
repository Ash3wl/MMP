--EphraimxMark--
\f[1|Mark]
\s[1]
Come on now, is this really all you have?|\n
What a bunch of weaklings...|\n
\f[1|MarkHappy]Or perhaps we're just too strong!|

\f[6|EphraimHappy]
\s[6]
Well, you're pretty tough, I'll give you that.|\n
It's hard to get a solid hit with so much bulk.|

\s[1]
So you aknowledge your inferiority?|\n
You can do nothing against us!\n
You might as well give up now.|

\s[6]
Hey now, I didn't say that.|\n
\f[6|Ephraim]You're bulky, but that doesn't mean invincible.|\n
\f[6|EphraimHappy]And you're about to learn that the hard way!|

\s[1]
\f[1|Mark]Meaningless words...|\n
I'll just have to show how you how weak you are!
