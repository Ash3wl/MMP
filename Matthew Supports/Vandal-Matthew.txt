--Matthew X Vandal 1--

\f[2|VandalSad]
\s[2]
Uh, Matthew, what exactly are we doing here?|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
What do you mean?\n
We were called by Marc to help get his stuff.|

\s[2]
I know, but isn't this a bit sudden?\n
We barely know any of these guys.|

\s[5]
Well I'm not complaining.|\n
\f[5|MatthewHappy]Besides, having more allies is always good, isn't it?\n
We'll probably get a pretty good reward either way.|

\f[2|Vandal]
\s[2]
Actually, talking about more allies...|\n
Why are we the only ones here?\n
Shouldn't we call the rest of the team?|\n

\f[5|MatthewSad]
\s[5]
O\m[5|5]-oh...|uh...|why should we?|

\f[2|VandalSad]
\s[2]
Uh?|\n
What do you mean, "why"?|\n
So we don't die, obviously!|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
About that...|\n
Today is cleaning day back at the residence...|

\f[2|Vandal]
\s[2]
What about i-ooooh....|\n
So that's what we're doing, huh?|

\f[5|MatthewHappy]
\s[5]
Hey, I won't tell if you won't.|

\f[2|VandalSad]
\s[2]
But she's going to be SO pissed at us.|\n
You know how she gets in cleaning days.|
 
\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
And that's why we're here.|

\f[2|VandalHappy]
\s[2]
Ah, I get it.|\n
\f[2|VandalSad]Suddenly, fighting here looks a lot more appealing...|

\f[5|MatthewHappy]
\s[5]
I knew you'd understand.\n
Shall we move?|

\f[2|Vandal]
\s[2]
Sure, let's go!|

--End--
--Matthew x Vandal 2--
\f[2|Matthew]
\s[2]
Yo, Vandy boi.|

\f[5|Vandal]
\s[5]
Hey.|

\f[2|MatthewSad]
\s[2]
Things have been picking up quite a bit, right?|

\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
You can say that again.\n
Didn't expect we'd be against these kinds of enemies.|

\f[2|Matthew]
\s[2]
That's right.|\n
But you know what they say.\n
"The bigger the fray, the bigger the pay!"|

\s[5]
Never heard that one before...|\n
\f[5|Vandal]But you're right, maybe we can win big here.|

\f[2|MatthewHappy]
\s[2]
Yup, that would be nice.|\n
\f[2|MatthewSad]Work has been lacking lately.|

\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
With people like these guys around, I guess people\n
don't really need simple mercenaries like us.|

\f[2|MatthewSad]
\s[2]
Ow, don't say that.|\n
It hurts my wallet and my feelings...|\n
\f[2|Matthew]I knew we should have brought fliers.|

\f[5|Vandal]
\s[5]
Fliers?\n
I mean, I don't see any pegasi around here.|

\s[2]
No, I mean like, paper fliers.|\n
Maybe we need more advertising.|

\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
I doubt that sort of adverstising would work...|\n
We don't exactly seem like the most trustworthy bunch.|

\s[2]
Are you sure?\n
Vesper and Jacke seem to bring in good buiness.|

\s[5]
Well...|of course they do...|

\f[2|MatthewHappy]
\s[2]
Well, either way, if we don't get paid, I'm sure\n
the people here have some valuable stuff on them...|

\f[5|VandalHappy]
\s[5]
Ohoho.|\n
Now you're speaking my language.|

--Matthew x Vandal3--
\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
...|

\f[2|Matthew]
\s[2]
Hey, Vandal, you seem kind of down.\n
What happened?|

\f[5|Vandal]
\s[5]
Oh, hey.|\n
\f[5|VandalSad]It's nothing, just...|\n
When they asked us to help recover something invaluable,\n
I was thinking of something more.\w[20].\w[20].\w[20]appealing.|

\s[2]
Oh, so that's it...|\n
\f[2|MatthewSad]I guess it was a bit unexpected.\n
Who knew Marc was into.\w[20].\w[20].\w[20]literature.|

\s[5]
Talk about a flop of a treasure.|\n
\f[5|Vandal]Those wacko magazines aren't even that good.\n
Even the ones Jerry has are better.|

\f[2|Matthew]
\s[2]
Huh?\n
Does Jerry have those kinds of magazines?|

\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
Uh, yeah?\n
You didn't know?|\n
\f[5|Vandal]Literally everyone knows he hides them.|

\f[2|MatthewSad]
\s[2]
Then how come I don't know that?|

\f[5|VandalSad]
\s[5]
We try to keep that info to ourselves.|\n
\f[5|Vandal]He doesn't know we know, so why ruin his fun?\n
Poor guy already barely has privacy with Vesper around.|

\f[2|Matthew]
\s[2]
Well, alright then.\n
I guess you learn something new everyday.|

\f[5|VandalHappy]
\s[5]
Yep.\n
Anyway, we should just get this over with.|\n
\f[5|Vandal]Marc's mags aren't even worth stealing after we're done.|

\f[2|MatthewSad]
\s[2]
You can say that again.|
--End--
--MatthewxVandal4--
\f[5|MatthewSad]
\s[5]
...|

\f[2|Vandal]
\s[2]
Huh?\n
Matthew, you alright?|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
Oh, I am.|\n
\f[5|MatthewSad]It's just, fighting with another team feels a bit weird.|

\s[2]
I can imagine.|\n
\f[2|VandalHappy]These guys aren't exactly the most normal.|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
Well, neither is our team.\n
But these guys seem like they're on a whole different level.|\n
\f[5|MatthewHappy]Their skill is something else.|

\f[2|Vandal]
\s[2]
I can agree with you on that.\n
Though they all seem to have fought themselves before.|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
Ah, so forced teamwork...|\n
\f[5|MatthewSad]Not exactly a fan, but if it gets us both\n
alive in the end, I guess I don't mind.|

\f[2|VandalHappy]
\s[2]
Not everything can be solved with\n
the power of friendship, you know.|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
Hey, I'm aware of that!\n
You know what I mean.|\n
\f[5|MatthewHappy]A team should be willing to fight for others\n
as much as they fight for themselves.|

\s[2]
How honorable of you.|\n
\f[2|Vandal]Either way, strength comes in bunches.|\n
Can't really judge them when they get the job done.|

\f[5|Matthew]
\s[5]
I suppose.|\n
I just hope we pull our weight over here.\n
Would be bad if we made any enemies out of these guys.|

\f[2|VandalHappy]
\s[2]
I don't think that's something to be worried about.|\n
They seem to all be together when shit hits the fan.|

\s[5]
What a strange relationship that must be.|\n
\f[5|MatthewHappy]But then again, strangeness comes in bunches as well.|

\s[2]
And that's our specialty, isn't it?|

\s[5]
You bet it is.|
